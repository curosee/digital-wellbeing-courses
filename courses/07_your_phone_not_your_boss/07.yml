gamma_prompt: >
  Create a visually engaging presentation for teens and young adults (ages 13-25) about taking control of screen habits. Use bold, modern design with high-contrast colors. Include real statistics about teen screen use. Tone should be empowering and relatable — like a cool older sibling, not a parent lecture. Feature practical tools like grayscale mode, app timers, and phone stacking. Include a 7-day experiment framework. No scare tactics. No shame. Just real talk about phones, brains, and building a life you actually control.

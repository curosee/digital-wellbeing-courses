**ID:** c2-m1  
**Access:** free  
**Estimated time:** 35 minutes  

### Lesson 1.1 – What “too much” really means

- Not only a number of hours.
- Look at:
  - sleep,
  - work/study,
  - relationships,
  - inner state.
- Simple table: “Costs of my screen use.”

### Lesson 1.2 – Mapping your day (gamified)

- Morning / afternoon / evening mapping.
- For each block:
  - main screen behaviors,
  - how long,
  - how you feel after.
- Printable as 1 page.
- Challenge: fill for 3 consecutive days.

### Lesson 1.3 – Nutritious, neutral, draining

- Define types:
  - Nutritious: learning, creating, meaningful connection.
  - Neutral: tools, functional apps.
  - Draining: endless scroll, compulsive checking.
- Exercise: mark each app or behavior with N / NE / D on a printed list.

### Lesson 1.4 – Your personal red flags

- Examples:
  - “I touch my phone in bed after deciding to sleep.”
  - “I open social media without noticing when I feel stressed.”
- Worksheet:
  - 3 sentences: “I feel bad about my screen use when…”
  - 3 sentences: “If nothing changes, in one year I fear that…”

### Lesson 1.5 – First experiment: the 60-second pause

- When urge appears:
  - Wait 60 seconds.
  - Notice thoughts, body sensations.
  - Then decide consciously: use or not.
- Challenge: try this once a day for 3 days.

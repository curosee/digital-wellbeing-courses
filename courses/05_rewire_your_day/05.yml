  Create a visually engaging course presentation for 'Rewire Your Day: Designing a Life That Doesn't Revolve Around Screens.' This is an intermediate-level course for adults redesigning their daily routines around intentional screen use. Use a warm, energizing design with dawn-to-dusk colors (warm oranges for morning, focused blues for midday, calming purples for evening). Include slides for: course overview, each of the 5 modules with key concepts, morning routine design, deep work blocks, friction engineering principles, sleep hygiene and blue light, and the Intentional Digital Life plan template. Tone should be practical and empowering. Include daily routine diagrams and before/after comparisons. No emojis.

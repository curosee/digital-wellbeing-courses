This is an advanced-level course for adults who have already built foundational screen habits and want to go deeper. Use a sophisticated, empowering design with deep blues, golds, and clean whites. Include slides for: course overview, the attention economy deep dive, neuroplasticity and brain rewiring, the emotional escape cycle, relapse prevention, digital sabbath, and the Attention Legacy plan. Include diagrams for the pleasure-pain balance, the emotional escape cycle, the relapse anatomy, and the Legacy framework. Tone should be mature, empowering, and forward-looking. No emojis.

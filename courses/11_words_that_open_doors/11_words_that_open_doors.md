### Lesson 1: Why Most Conversations Go Wrong

**Learning goal**: Identify the common mistakes that turn well-intentioned conversations about screen use into arguments, so you can avoid them.

You have tried to talk to them. Maybe many times. And it has not gone well. The conversation starts with your concern and ends with their defensiveness. Or their silence. Or a fight that leaves you both feeling worse than before.

You are not bad at talking. The problem is not your communication skills. The problem is that conversations about compulsive behavior are uniquely difficult, and almost no one teaches us how to have them.

Here are the most common mistakes. The ambush: you bring it up when they are mid-screen, mid-game, mid-scroll. Their brain is somewhere else. They feel attacked. The accusation opener: "You are always on that phone." "You never spend time with us." "All you do is game." These statements may feel true, but they start the conversation in a place the other person has to defend against. The fix-it mode: you come in with a plan — time limits, app blockers, a new schedule. They did not ask for a plan. They feel managed, not understood. The emotional dump: you release all the frustration you have been holding back at once. It is too much. They cannot hear your pain through the volume of it.

None of these approaches are wrong in their intention. You want to connect. You want things to change. But the execution matters more than the intention. The same message, delivered differently, lands in a completely different place.

The good news is that there are specific, learnable ways to have these conversations that dramatically increase the chances of being heard. That is what this course is about.

**Reflection**: Think about the last conversation you had about their screen use. Which of the patterns above was present? What happened as a result? No judgment — just observation.

**Key takeaway**: Most conversations about screen use fail not because of what you want to say, but because of how and when you say it.

### Lesson 2: Check Your Emotional Weather

**Learning goal**: Learn to assess your own emotional state before initiating a conversation, and recognize when you need to wait.

Before you talk to them, you need to talk to yourself. Not in a motivational-poster way. In a practical, honest way. Because your emotional state when you start a conversation determines where that conversation goes.

If you are angry, the conversation will sound like an attack — no matter how carefully you choose your words. If you are desperate, the conversation will sound like begging — and desperation invites dismissal. If you are exhausted, you will not have the patience to listen, and listening is the most powerful thing you can do. If you are scared, you may say too much too fast, overwhelming them before they have a chance to engage.

This does not mean you need to be perfectly calm. That is not realistic. It means you need to be regulated enough to be intentional. There is a difference between feeling angry and acting from anger. You can feel angry and still choose a thoughtful approach.

Check your emotional weather before every important conversation. Ask yourself: Can I listen right now, truly listen, or do I just need to be heard? Am I trying to connect, or am I trying to win? If they say something defensive, can I stay steady? If the answer to any of these is no, wait. Have the conversation later. Later today. Tomorrow. This week. The conversation will still be there. Having it when you are ready is always better than having it when you are reactive.

**Exercise**: Create a personal "readiness checklist" — three to five questions you will ask yourself before initiating a difficult conversation. Keep it somewhere accessible. Use it every time.

**Key takeaway**: Your emotional state determines the conversation's trajectory. Checking your own weather before you speak is not weakness. It is wisdom.

### Lesson 3: What Do You Actually Want?

**Learning goal**: Clarify your real goal for a conversation so you can approach with focus and intention rather than scattered frustration.

When you think about talking to them about their screen use, what do you actually want? This question seems simple. It is not.

Most supporters, when they are honest, discover that they have multiple goals tangled together. They want the person to reduce their screen time. They want to feel connected again. They want to be heard. They want acknowledgment that there is a problem. They want an apology. They want reassurance that the person still cares. They want the old version of the relationship back. They want to stop worrying.

All of these are legitimate. But you cannot pursue all of them in one conversation. If you try, the conversation becomes unfocused, overwhelming, and confusing for both of you.

Before you speak, choose one goal. Just one. And make it as clear and specific as possible. "I want to understand what they get from gaming" is a clear goal. "I want to express how I feel when they are on their phone during dinner" is a clear goal. "I want to ask if they would be open to one screen-free evening a week" is a clear goal.

Notice what these goals have in common. They are achievable. They are specific. And they do not require the other person to have a complete transformation. That is important. If your goal for a conversation is "I want them to realize they have a problem and agree to change," you are setting yourself up for disappointment. Change is a process. Each conversation is one step in that process.

**Exercise**: Write down everything you want from a conversation about their screen use. Get it all out. Then circle just one thing. The most important thing right now. That is your goal for the next conversation.

**Key takeaway**: One clear, achievable goal per conversation. That is how progress happens — one step at a time.

---

### Lesson 4: The Mindset Shift

**Learning goal**: Move from a fixing mindset to a connecting mindset, which paradoxically makes change more likely.

There is a paradox at the heart of helping someone change. The harder you try to fix them, the more they resist. The more you focus on understanding them, the more open they become.

This is not just folk wisdom. It is the foundational principle of Motivational Interviewing, one of the most researched approaches to behavior change in the world. William Miller and Stephen Rollnick, who developed MI, discovered something counterintuitive: when a counselor argues for change, the client argues against it. When the counselor listens, reflects, and explores, the client begins to argue for change themselves.

This means your job in these conversations is not to convince them. It is not to present evidence. It is not to make them see the light. Your job is to create a space where they feel safe enough to be honest — with you and with themselves.

The mindset shift sounds like this. From "I need to make them understand" to "I want to understand them." From "I need to tell them what to do" to "I want to hear what they think." From "I have the answer" to "I wonder what they need." From "This conversation has to produce a result" to "This conversation is about connection."

This shift does not mean you abandon your own needs. It does not mean you stop caring about the outcome. It means you recognize that the fastest path to change runs through understanding, not through force.

**Reflection**: Which mindset do you default to — fixing or connecting? Be honest. There is no wrong answer. Awareness is the first step.

**Key takeaway**: The paradox of change — the less you try to fix, the more space you create for change to happen.

### Module 1 Challenge: The Pre-Conversation Check-In

Before your next conversation about screen use, pause and answer these questions in writing. What am I feeling right now? What is my real goal for this conversation — just one? Am I trying to control or to connect? Am I emotionally ready, or do I need to wait? Is this the right time and place? Write your answers down. Read them back. Do not have the conversation until you can answer these honestly and feel grounded. This practice alone can transform how your conversations go.

# Module 2: The Art of the Opener

## Starting without starting a fight

---

### Lesson 1: The First Thirty Seconds

**Learning goal**: Understand that the opening moments of a conversation set the entire emotional tone and determine whether the other person will engage or shut down.

Research from the Gottman Institute has shown that you can predict the outcome of a conversation with remarkable accuracy based on the first three minutes alone. If a conversation starts with what John Gottman calls a "harsh startup" — criticism, contempt, blame — it will almost certainly end badly. If it starts with a "soft startup" — gentleness, respect, a genuine bid for connection — the chances of a productive exchange increase dramatically.

This means the first thirty seconds matter more than anything else you say. More than your arguments. More than your evidence. More than how right you are. If you lose them in the opening, nothing that follows can recover it.

A harsh startup sounds like: "We need to talk about your screen use." Even this seemingly neutral sentence can land like a hammer because the other person knows what follows. They have heard it before. Their defenses go up before you finish the sentence.

A soft startup sounds different. It sounds like an invitation, not a summons. It sounds like curiosity, not judgment. It sounds like someone who wants to connect, not someone who wants to correct.

The good news is that this is a skill, not a personality trait. You can learn to start conversations softly, even when you are feeling anything but soft inside. The next few lessons will show you exactly how.

**Reflection**: Think about how conversations about screen use typically start in your relationship. Who usually initiates? What words are used? How does the other person respond in those first moments?

**Key takeaway**: The first thirty seconds determine the entire conversation. A soft startup is the single most powerful thing you can do.

---

### Lesson 2: Lead with Curiosity, Not Criticism

**Learning goal**: Learn to use open-ended questions that invite the other person to share, rather than statements that put them on the defensive.

The most powerful conversation tool you have is a question. Not a rhetorical question. Not an accusation disguised as a question. A real, genuinely curious question — one where you actually want to hear the answer.

In Motivational Interviewing, the "O" in OARS stands for Open questions. Open questions cannot be answered with yes or no. They invite the other person to think, to reflect, to share. They signal that you are interested in their experience, not just waiting to make your point.

Here are examples of open questions you might use. "What do you enjoy most about gaming?" "How do you feel when you are online versus when you are not?" "What would your ideal day look like if you could design it?" "Is there anything about your screen use that bothers you?" "What would change look like for you?"

Notice what these questions do. They treat the other person as the expert on their own experience. They do not assume. They do not diagnose. They open a door and wait.

Compare these with closed or loaded questions. "Don't you think you spend too much time on your phone?" "Do you even care about this family?" "Why can't you just put it down?" These questions have the answer built in. They are not questions at all. They are criticisms wearing a question mark.

Leading with curiosity takes practice, especially when you are frustrated. But it works. When someone feels genuinely curious about their experience rather than judgmental, they lower their guard. And behind that guard is usually someone who is more aware of the problem than you might think.

**Exercise**: Write down five open questions you could ask the person you are worried about. Make sure each one is something you are genuinely curious about. Practice saying them in a tone of real interest, not interrogation.

**Key takeaway**: A genuinely curious question opens more doors than the most carefully crafted argument.

---

### Lesson 3: The Power of "I" Statements

**Learning goal**: Express your own feelings and needs without blame, using "I" statements that keep the conversation safe.

"You" statements attack. "I" statements share. This distinction is simple in theory and revolutionary in practice.

A "you" statement sounds like: "You are always on your phone." "You never listen to me." "You don't care about anything but your games." Each of these puts the other person on trial. Their only options are to defend, deny, or counterattack. None of these are productive.

An "I" statement sounds like: "I feel lonely when we don't talk in the evening." "I miss the time we used to spend together." "I worry when I see you staying up so late." "I feel disconnected, and I don't like that feeling."

Notice the shift. You are sharing your experience, not diagnosing theirs. You are describing your feelings, not assigning blame. The other person does not need to defend themselves because they are not being attacked. They can simply hear you.

"I" statements are not magic. Some people will still become defensive. But they dramatically reduce the chances of escalation. And they model something important — vulnerability. When you share how you feel rather than what they did wrong, you are showing that this conversation is about connection, not control.

There is an important nuance. "I feel like you are addicted" is not a real "I" statement. It is a "you" statement in disguise. A real "I" statement stays with your experience. "I feel scared when I think about what might be happening" is genuine. "I feel hurt when we have plans and the screen takes priority" is genuine. Stay with what you feel, not what you think about them.

**Exercise**: Take three "you" statements you have said or thought recently and rewrite them as genuine "I" statements. Notice how it changes the energy. Practice saying them out loud.

**Key takeaway**: "I" statements share your experience without putting the other person on trial. They keep the conversation safe enough for honesty.

---

### Lesson 4: Timing, Setting, and Tone

**Learning goal**: Choose the right moment, place, and tone for a conversation, because even the perfect words fail in the wrong context.

You could have the best opening line in the world, and it would still fail if you said it at the wrong time, in the wrong place, or in the wrong tone. Context matters as much as content.

Timing. Do not start a conversation when they are mid-screen. Their brain is occupied. You will not have their attention, and the interruption itself will start the conversation with friction. Do not start when you are depleted — after a long day, late at night, or in the middle of another conflict. Choose a moment when you are both relatively calm and available. Side-by-side activities — driving, walking, cooking — can be ideal because they reduce the intensity of face-to-face confrontation.

Setting. Privacy matters. Do not bring up screen use in front of other family members, friends, or in public. This creates shame, and shame shuts people down. Choose a setting that feels safe and comfortable. If this is your child, their room might feel like their territory in a good way. If this is your partner, a quiet walk might work better than across a table.

Tone. Your tone carries more information than your words. Research on communication suggests that tone of voice accounts for a significant portion of how a message is received. A gentle, warm tone says "I care about you." A tight, controlled tone says "I am trying not to yell." A flat tone says "I have given up." Practice the tone you want before you speak.

One more thing: brevity. Short conversations are often more effective than long ones. Say what you need to say. Ask what you want to ask. Then stop. Give them space to process. You do not have to resolve everything in one sitting. In fact, you almost certainly will not. And that is okay.

**Exercise**: Plan the logistics for your next conversation. When will you initiate it? Where? What will you be doing? How long will you aim to keep it? Write this down alongside the opening line you prepared in the previous lesson.

**Key takeaway**: The right words at the wrong time still fail. Plan the when, where, and how as carefully as the what.

---

### Module 2 Challenge: Your Opening Line

Write three different ways you could open a conversation about screen use with the person you love. Each one should lead with curiosity or an "I" statement. Each one should be a soft startup. Practice saying them out loud — in the mirror, to a friend, or recorded on your phone. Listen to how they sound. Choose the one that feels most natural and genuine. You do not have to use it yet. But have it ready. And write down the timing, setting, and tone you plan to use when the moment comes.

# Module 3: Listen Like You Mean It

## Advanced listening for hard topics

---

### Lesson 1: OARS — The Listening Framework That Changes Everything

**Learning goal**: Learn the four components of the OARS technique from Motivational Interviewing and understand how each one creates safety and openness.

OARS is the core listening framework of Motivational Interviewing. It stands for Open questions, Affirmations, Reflective listening, and Summarizing. Together, these four skills create a conversational environment where the other person feels genuinely heard — and when people feel heard, they become more honest, more open, and more willing to consider change.

We covered Open questions in the last module. Now let us look at the full framework.

Open questions invite the other person to explore their own thoughts and feelings. They start with what, how, or tell me about. They signal genuine curiosity. "What does gaming give you that you can't find elsewhere?" "How do you feel about the amount of time you spend online?" "Tell me about what you enjoy most in that game."

Affirmations recognize the other person's strengths, efforts, and positive qualities. They are not compliments or flattery. They are genuine acknowledgments. "It takes courage to talk about this." "I can see you have been thinking about this." "You clearly care about doing well in your life." Affirmations reduce defensiveness because they remind the person that you see them as more than their problem.

Reflective listening means repeating back what you hear, in your own words, to confirm understanding and show that you are truly listening. This is the most powerful skill in OARS, and we will practice it extensively in the next lesson.

Summarizing means pulling together what has been shared at the end of a conversation or a section of it. "So what I am hearing is..." Summaries show that you have been paying attention. They give the other person a chance to correct misunderstandings. And they create a sense of shared understanding.

When you use OARS together, something shifts. The other person stops defending and starts reflecting. And that reflection is where change begins.

**Exercise**: Write down one example of each OARS skill that you could use with the person you are worried about. One open question. One affirmation. One reflective statement. One summary. Keep them ready.

**Key takeaway**: OARS creates a conversational environment where people feel safe enough to be honest. That honesty is the starting point for change.

---

### Lesson 2: Reflective Listening in Practice

**Learning goal**: Practice the skill of reflective listening — hearing what someone says and reflecting it back in a way that deepens understanding and builds trust.

Reflective listening is the heart of OARS. It is also the skill that feels most unnatural at first. That is because most of us do not actually listen. We wait. We plan our response. We judge. We fix. We listen just long enough to find the flaw in the argument and then pounce.

Reflective listening is different. It means setting aside your own agenda for a moment and truly hearing what the other person is saying. Then, instead of responding with your opinion, you respond with a reflection — a statement that captures what they said and, ideally, what they meant.

There are two levels of reflection. Simple reflection repeats or slightly rephrases what they said. They say: "I just need to decompress after work." You say: "Work has been really stressful and screens help you unwind." Complex reflection goes deeper, capturing the emotion or meaning beneath the words. They say: "I just need to decompress after work." You say: "It sounds like you are carrying a lot, and the screen is one of the few places where you can let it go."

Notice what happens with the complex reflection. You have not judged. You have not offered an alternative. You have not said "but." You have simply shown that you heard them at a deeper level. This kind of listening is disarming. When someone feels truly understood, their defenses lower. They do not need to fight to be heard. And in that open space, they often start to hear themselves more clearly too.

Reflective listening is a skill that improves with practice. It will feel awkward at first. You will get it wrong sometimes. The other person might correct you — and that is actually a good thing, because it deepens the conversation further. "That is not quite what I meant" is a sign of engagement, not failure.

**Exercise**: Practice reflective listening in a low-stakes conversation this week — with a friend, a colleague, anyone. For five minutes, resist the urge to advise, judge, or share your own experience. Just reflect back what you hear. Notice what happens.

**Key takeaway**: Reflective listening is the most powerful tool you have. It does not require you to agree. It requires you to understand. And understanding opens doors.

---

### Lesson 3: Listening for the Need Behind the Words

**Learning goal**: Develop the ability to hear the unmet needs and emotions beneath what someone says about their screen use, even when the words are defensive or dismissive.

People rarely say exactly what they mean, especially about topics that carry shame. When someone with compulsive screen use talks about their behavior, the words on the surface often mask something deeper. Learning to listen for that deeper layer is one of the most valuable skills you can develop.

They say: "It's not a big deal. Everyone games." What they might mean: "I am afraid that if I admit it is a problem, I will have to change, and I do not know if I can."

They say: "Just leave me alone." What they might mean: "I feel judged and controlled, and the screen is the one place where no one criticizes me."

They say: "You are the one with the problem, not me." What they might mean: "I am scared that you are right, and I am not ready to face that."

They say: "I'll cut back tomorrow." What they might mean: "I want you to stop being upset. I do not actually know how to cut back."

You do not need to be a mind reader. You do not need to be right. You just need to be curious enough to wonder what is underneath. And you can check. "It sounds like this is a bigger topic than it might seem." "I wonder if there is something else going on that makes this hard to talk about." "It seems like this might be about more than just screen time."

This kind of listening draws on what Motivational Interviewing calls "developing discrepancy" — helping someone see, through their own words, the gap between where they are and where they want to be. But it only works if they feel safe. And they only feel safe if they feel heard.

**Reflection**: Think about something defensive or dismissive they have said about their screen use. What might the words beneath the words be? Write down your guess. Hold it lightly — it is a hypothesis, not a verdict.

**Key takeaway**: The most important things are usually said beneath the surface. Listen for the need behind the words, and you will hear what they cannot yet say directly.

---

### Lesson 4: What to Do When They Shut Down

**Learning goal**: Learn strategies for staying calm and present when the other person withdraws, becomes angry, or refuses to engage.

You will do everything right. You will choose the right time. You will lead with curiosity. You will use "I" statements. You will listen deeply. And sometimes, they will still shut down. They will walk away. They will put headphones on. They will say "I don't want to talk about this." They will get angry. They will go silent.

This is one of the most painful moments for a supporter. It feels like rejection. It feels like proof that they do not care. But shutting down is usually not about you. It is about them — their overwhelm, their shame, their fear, their inability to sit with uncomfortable emotions. Remember the compensatory internet use model: if screens are how they manage difficult feelings, then a conversation that brings up difficult feelings is exactly the kind of thing they want to escape from.

When they shut down, here is what to do. First, regulate yourself. Take a breath. Ground your feet on the floor. You are okay. This moment is uncomfortable, but it is not dangerous. Second, name what you see with compassion. "I can see this is really hard to talk about." "It seems like you need some space right now, and that is okay." Third, leave the door open. "I am here whenever you are ready." "This does not have to be today." "I love you, and this can wait." Fourth, walk away gently. Do not slam a door. Do not give them the silent treatment in return. Do not punish. Just step back and tend to yourself.

Then — and this is crucial — do not interpret their shutdown as the final answer. People often need time to process. Something you said might land hours or days later. You may never get credit for the seed you planted. But that does not mean it did not take root.

**Exercise**: Write a script for what you will say to yourself when they shut down. Something grounding and true. "Their shutdown is not about my worth." "I did my best, and that is enough." "I can try again another time." Keep it accessible for when you need it.

**Key takeaway**: Shutting down is not rejection. It is overwhelm. Leave the door open, tend to yourself, and trust that seeds can grow in silence.

---

### Module 3 Challenge: The Listening Practice

Have a five-minute conversation with anyone — the person you are worried about, a friend, a family member — where your only goal is to listen using OARS. Ask at least two open questions. Affirm something they share. Reflect back what you hear at least twice. Summarize at the end. Resist the urge to share your own opinion, to fix anything, or to redirect the conversation. When it is over, write down what happened. How did it feel to listen this way? How did the other person respond? What did you learn? This practice will serve you in every important conversation for the rest of your life.

# Module 4: Boundaries Without Battles

## Protecting yourself while staying connected

---

### Lesson 1: Boundaries Are Not Punishments

**Learning goal**: Understand what a boundary truly is — a line that protects you, not a weapon that punishes them.

There is a critical distinction that most people miss, and it changes everything: a boundary is about you. A punishment is about them.

A boundary says: "I will not sit in silence while you scroll through dinner. I will eat my meal and then go do something I enjoy." A punishment says: "If you bring your phone to the table, I am taking it away."

A boundary says: "I need to sleep, so I am going to the bedroom at 10 p.m. whether or not you come." A punishment says: "If you stay up gaming past 10, you are sleeping on the couch."

A boundary says: "I am not going to have this conversation while you are looking at your phone. I am happy to talk when you are available." A punishment says: "Fine. I will just stop talking to you entirely."

See the difference? A boundary defines what you will do. A punishment tries to control what they do. A boundary protects your wellbeing. A punishment retaliates for their behavior. A boundary can be held with warmth. A punishment is inherently adversarial.

This distinction matters enormously. When you set a boundary, you are exercising your right to take care of yourself. You are not asking for permission, and you are not issuing a threat. You are simply being clear about what you need and what you will do to meet that need. This is healthy. This is your right. And paradoxically, clear boundaries often improve relationships rather than damaging them — because they replace the cycle of resentment, explosion, and guilt with clarity and honesty.

**Reflection**: Think about the rules or limits you have tried to set around their screen use. Were they boundaries (about what you will do) or punishments (about what they must do)? There is no judgment here. Just clarity.

**Key takeaway**: A boundary protects you. A punishment targets them. Knowing the difference is the foundation of healthy limit-setting.

---

### Lesson 2: The Anatomy of a Good Boundary

**Learning goal**: Learn to construct a boundary that is clear, specific, compassionate, and enforceable — and that you can actually hold.

A good boundary has four qualities. It is clear. It is specific. It is about your own behavior. And it is something you can actually follow through on.

Clear means there is no ambiguity. "I need more quality time" is a wish, not a boundary. "On Tuesday and Thursday evenings, I am going to plan an activity for us. If you choose to join, wonderful. If not, I will do it alone or with a friend" is a boundary.

Specific means it describes a concrete situation and a concrete action. "I won't tolerate this anymore" is vague. "When we are in the car together, I am going to ask that screens stay in pockets so we can talk. If that does not happen, I will drive in silence rather than compete with a screen" is specific.

About your own behavior means the boundary describes what you will do, not what they must do. You cannot enforce their behavior. You can enforce your own. "You have to stop gaming after 9 p.m." is unenforceable — you are not their warden. "I am going to bed at 10 p.m. and I would love your company, but I am going regardless" is enforceable because it depends only on you.

Actually holdable means you can realistically follow through. Do not set a boundary you know you will not keep. If you say "I will leave the house if you game past midnight" but you know you will not actually leave, the boundary means nothing and your credibility erodes. Start with boundaries you can genuinely hold, even if they feel small.

**Exercise**: Write one boundary using this template: "When [specific situation happens], I will [specific action I will take for myself]." Test it: Is it clear? Specific? About your behavior? Can you actually hold it?

**Key takeaway**: A good boundary is clear, specific, about your own actions, and something you can actually follow through on. Start small and build from there.

---

### Lesson 3: Holding the Line with Compassion

**Learning goal**: Learn to maintain your boundaries when they are tested — because they will be — while keeping warmth and connection intact.

Setting a boundary is the easy part. Holding it is where the real work begins.

When you set a boundary, expect it to be tested. This is not because the other person is trying to be difficult. It is because they are used to the old pattern. The old pattern may have been uncomfortable for both of you, but it was familiar. Boundaries disrupt familiarity, and disruption creates resistance.

They might get angry. They might dismiss your boundary as controlling. They might try to negotiate. They might test the boundary by doing exactly what you said would not work for you, to see if you actually follow through. This is normal. It does not mean your boundary is wrong.

Holding the line with compassion looks like this. Stay calm. Use a warm, steady voice. Repeat the boundary simply without lengthy explanations. "I know this is hard. I am still going to bed at 10." Do not argue about whether the boundary is fair. Do not justify yourself endlessly. Do not get pulled into a debate about screen time. The boundary is about you, and you do not need their permission or agreement.

At the same time, stay connected. A boundary is not a wall. It is a fence with a gate. "I love you. I need sleep. I am going to bed. I hope you will join me." You can be firm and warm at the same time. In fact, that combination — firmness with warmth — is the most powerful one available to you.

If you slip — if you fail to hold the boundary one time — do not give up. Restate it. Try again. Consistency over time matters more than perfection in any single moment.

**Reflection**: Think about a boundary you have tried to set in the past that did not hold. What happened? What got in the way? Was it the boundary itself that was the problem, or was it the follow-through?

**Key takeaway**: Boundaries will be tested. Hold them with warmth and without apology. Consistency matters more than perfection.

---

### Lesson 4: Boundaries in Different Relationships

**Learning goal**: Understand how boundary-setting differs depending on whether the person is your partner, your child, your friend, or your sibling.

The principles of good boundaries are universal. But the application changes depending on the relationship. What works with a partner may not work with a teenager. What is appropriate with a friend is different from what is appropriate with a sibling who lives in your home.

With a partner, boundaries are about protecting the relationship and your own wellbeing within it. You have the right to screen-free meals, screen-free conversations, and undivided attention during important moments. You also have the right to say, "This pattern is not sustainable for me," and to mean it. Partner boundaries are between equals. Neither of you has authority over the other. What you have is a shared commitment to the relationship that gives both of you standing to ask for what you need.

With a child, boundaries are more complex because you have both a caregiving responsibility and a need to foster autonomy. Ross Greene's Collaborative and Proactive Solutions model is especially useful here. Instead of imposing rules unilaterally, CPS involves identifying the problem together, understanding the child's concerns, sharing yours, and collaboratively brainstorming a solution. Research shows that when adolescents participate in creating rules, they are more likely to follow them. MI conducted with both a parent and adolescent together yields larger effect sizes than working with either alone.

With a friend, your boundaries are softer but no less valid. You cannot control their behavior, and you do not live with the daily impact the way a partner or parent does. But you can say, "I need you to be present when we are together." You can choose to spend less time with them if they are consistently unavailable. You can express concern without monitoring compliance.

With a sibling, especially one you live with, boundaries may involve shared spaces — the dinner table, the living room, car rides. You may need to involve parents or other family members in setting household norms, while also setting personal boundaries about your own space and attention.

**Exercise**: Identify which relationship category applies to your situation. Write one boundary that is appropriate for that specific dynamic. Consider: what do you have the right and the ability to set a boundary around?

**Key takeaway**: The same boundary principles apply everywhere, but the execution changes with the relationship. Know your role, your rights, and your limits.

### Module 4 Challenge: One Boundary This Week

Identify one boundary you need to set. Write it down using this format: "When [specific situation], I will [specific action I will take for myself]." Make sure it is about your behavior, not theirs. Make sure it is something you can actually hold. Share it with a trusted person — a friend, a therapist, a family member — for accountability. Then hold it for one week. At the end of the week, write down what happened. How did they respond? How did you feel? Did you hold it? What did you learn? One boundary, held consistently, is worth more than a dozen rules never enforced.

# Module 5: When They're Not Ready

## What to do when nothing seems to work

### Lesson 1: The Stages of Change

**Learning goal**: Understand Prochaska and DiClemente's Stages of Change model and recognize which stage the person you love might be in.

Change is not a single moment. It is a process with identifiable stages. Understanding where someone is in that process changes what you do and what you expect.

The Stages of Change model, developed by James Prochaska and Carlo DiClemente, identifies five stages. Precontemplation: they do not see a problem. They are not thinking about change. If you bring it up, they dismiss it. Contemplation: they are starting to wonder if something is wrong. They might make comments like "I should probably cut back" but take no action. Preparation: they are ready to make a change and may be taking small steps. Action: they are actively changing their behavior. Maintenance: they are sustaining the change over time.

Most supporters want the person they love to be in the action stage. But the person they love is often in precontemplation or contemplation. And here is the crucial insight: what helps at each stage is different. Trying to push someone in precontemplation into action does not work. It is like trying to run before you have learned to walk.

In precontemplation, the most helpful thing you can do is plant seeds of awareness — without forcing. Share information gently. Ask curious questions. Describe what you observe without diagnosing. In contemplation, the most helpful thing is to support their growing awareness — reflect back the ambivalence you hear, affirm their honesty, resist the urge to push them forward faster than they are ready to go. In preparation, the most helpful thing is to offer practical support — help them find a therapist, research options, celebrate small steps.

Knowing the stage does not make the waiting easier. But it helps you understand that their lack of action is not about lack of care. It is about readiness. And readiness cannot be forced.

**Reflection**: Which stage of change do you think the person you love is in right now? What evidence leads you to that assessment? What kind of support matches that stage?

**Key takeaway**: Change is a process, not an event. Meeting someone where they are — instead of where you want them to be — is the most effective support you can offer.

### Lesson 2: Planting Seeds You May Never See Grow

**Learning goal**: Find meaning and motivation in actions that may not produce visible results, trusting that influence works over time.

This might be the hardest part of being a supporter. You do the right things. You listen. You set boundaries. You invite. You stay patient. And nothing seems to change.

But here is what the research on behavior change tells us: change rarely happens because of one conversation or one event. It happens because of an accumulation of moments — seeds planted over weeks, months, sometimes years — that eventually reach a tipping point. You may never get to see the moment when the seed you planted breaks through the soil. But that does not mean you did not plant it.

Think about the people who influenced your own life. A teacher who said one thing that changed your direction. A friend who believed in you when you did not believe in yourself. A parent who stayed patient during your worst years. Did they see the result of their influence? Maybe not. But the influence was real.

Every time you listen without judging, you plant a seed. Every time you express love alongside concern, you plant a seed. Every time you maintain a boundary with warmth, you plant a seed. Every time you model a life that is not ruled by screens, you plant a seed. These seeds are not wasted just because you cannot see them growing.

This does not mean you should wait forever. There are limits to patience, and we will discuss them. But in this moment, give yourself credit for the quiet, invisible work you are doing. It matters more than you know.

**Exercise**: Write down three seeds you have already planted — things you have said, done, or modeled that the person you love may have noticed, even if they did not respond. Acknowledge them. They count.

**Key takeaway**: Influence is cumulative and often invisible. The seeds you plant today may not bloom for months or years. That does not mean they are not growing.

### Lesson 3: Protecting Hope Without Enabling

**Learning goal**: Learn the difference between patient, loving support and enabling behavior that allows the problem to continue unchecked.

There is a fine line between patience and enabling. Both look like waiting. But they come from very different places and lead to very different outcomes.

Patience says: "I believe you can change, and I will be here while you figure it out, while also taking care of myself." Enabling says: "I will absorb all the consequences of your behavior so that you never have to face them."

Enabling looks like: making excuses for them. Covering for missed work, missed commitments, missed relationships. Absorbing the financial cost of their screen habits without discussion. Tip-toeing around the problem to keep the peace. Giving up your own needs to avoid triggering their defensiveness. Doing their responsibilities because they are too absorbed to do them themselves.

Enabling is not love, even though it feels like love. It is fear. Fear of conflict. Fear of rejection. Fear of making things worse. And it keeps the other person insulated from the natural consequences of their behavior — consequences that are often the very thing that motivates change.

You can be patient and still hold boundaries. You can be loving and still allow them to experience the consequences of their choices. You can be hopeful and still honest. These are not contradictions. They are the hallmarks of mature, sustainable support.

If you recognize enabling patterns in yourself, be gentle. You were doing the best you could. But now you know more, and you can begin to shift.

**Reflection**: Is there a way you have been shielding the person you love from the consequences of their screen use? Be honest. What would change if you stopped?

**Key takeaway**: Patience is not the same as enabling. You can love someone, believe in their capacity to change, and still allow them to face reality.

### Lesson 4: Knowing When You Have Done Enough

**Learning goal**: Give yourself permission to set limits on your own support, recognizing that you cannot save someone who is not ready to participate in their own change.

You are here because you love someone. That love has driven you to learn, to change your approach, to develop new skills, to stretch your patience beyond what you thought possible. That love is real and powerful and worthy of respect.

But love does not obligate you to burn yourself down. There is a point where you have done everything you can, and the rest is up to them. Recognizing that point is not failure. It is wisdom.

You have done enough when you have communicated your concern clearly and lovingly. When you have set and held your boundaries. When you have taken care of your own wellbeing. When you have offered support without controlling. When you have been patient through the stages of change. When you have sought your own support from friends, family, or a therapist.

You have done enough even if they have not changed. Because your worth as a supporter is not measured by their outcome. You are responsible for your actions, not for their choices.

This does not mean you give up on them. You can continue to love someone, to leave the door open, to maintain connection — while also acknowledging that you cannot do their work for them. You can say, "I love you. I am here. And I am also going to live my life, because that is what I need to do."

Sometimes, stepping back is the most loving thing you can do. It gives them space. It gives you air. And sometimes, it is the absence of your tireless effort that finally creates the space for them to take responsibility for their own.

**Exercise**: Complete this sentence: "I have done enough when..." Write at least three endings. Read them to yourself. Let them sink in. You do not need to reach that point today. But knowing where it is gives you ground to stand on.

**Key takeaway**: You are not responsible for saving someone who is not ready to save themselves. Knowing your limits is an act of love — for them and for you.

### Module 5 Challenge: The Letter You Do Not Send

Write a letter to the person you are worried about. Say everything. Your love. Your fear. Your frustration. Your hope. Your exhaustion. Your belief in them. Your need to take care of yourself. Be completely honest. Use everything you have learned — "I" statements, reflections, affirmations, boundaries. Write it all down. Then put it away. You do not send it. This letter is for you. It is a way of saying what needs to be said without requiring them to hear it yet. Keep it somewhere safe. You may choose to share it one day. You may not. Either way, you have given yourself the gift of being fully heard — by yourself.

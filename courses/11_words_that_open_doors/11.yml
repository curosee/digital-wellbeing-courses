gamma_prompt: |
  Create a warm, practical slide deck titled "Words That Open Doors" for people who need to have difficult conversations about a loved one's screen use. The tone should be like a skilled therapist coaching you before a hard conversation — calm, specific, empowering. Use warm, grounding colors (deep blues, warm ambers, soft creams). Include visual frameworks for OARS, the Stages of Change model, and boundary-setting. Show diverse relationship types in imagery — partners, parents with teens, friends, siblings. Include speech bubble examples of what to say and what not to say. Each module should feel like a practical workshop. End with the boundary-setting template as a take-home tool. Avoid any imagery that suggests conflict or blame.

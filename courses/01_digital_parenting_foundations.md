## 2. Module 1 – Understanding Your Child’s Relationship With Screens  
**ID:** c1-m1  
**Access:** free, no login  
**Estimated time:** 35–40 minutes  
**XP:** 60 base XP (reading) + 35 XP (exercises) + 15 XP (challenge) = 110 XP

### Lesson 1.1 – Why screens are so attractive

**Learning goal:**  
Parent understands that their child’s attraction to screens is not a defect, but a normal reaction to powerful design and unmet needs.

**Content (short, translatable paragraphs):**

- Screens give frequent small rewards:
  - new levels, likes, funny clips, new messages.
  - Each reward gives a small burst of motivation.
- Screens create a place where children feel strong:
  - They can win, progress, and feel competent.
  - This is important if they feel small in other areas.
- Screens are social:
  - Friends talk about games and apps.
  - Being “out of the app” can feel like being “out of the group”.
- Screens help to escape:
  - Boredom, stress, conflict, sadness.
  - One tap and the feeling disappears for a moment.

**Exercise (worksheet block):**

On a printed page, three columns:

1. “Game or app my child loves”  
2. “What they get from it” (fun, success, connection, calm)  
3. “What worries me about it”  

Parent fills 3–5 lines.

### Lesson 1.2 – Normal friction vs worrying signs

**Learning goal:**  
Parent can separate typical short-term friction from more persistent problems.

**Content:**

- Normal friction:
  - Child complains when time is over.
  - Child asks for “5 more minutes”.
  - Child speaks a lot about a favorite game or show.
- Worrying patterns:
  - Daily conflicts about screens.
  - Screens often disrupt:
    - sleep,
    - homework,
    - meals,
    - family time.
  - Very strong reactions when limits appear:
    - repeated shouting, hitting, breaking things.
    - refusal to do anything without screens.
  - Loss of interest in offline activities they liked before.

**Self-check (printable list with checkboxes):**

> “In the last 2 weeks, how often did this happen?”  
> 
> - [ ] Conflict about screens almost every day  
> - [ ] Screens in bed after lights out  
> - [ ] Homework regularly delayed because of screens  
> - [ ] My child no longer wants activities they used to enjoy

### Lesson 1.3 – Your own story with screens

**Learning goal:**  
Parent sees their own habits and beliefs as part of the system, not as a separate judge.

**Content:**

- Your own childhood may have had:
  - little or no internet,
  - fixed TV times,
  - fewer devices.
- Your child’s world:
  - screens at home, in school, in public spaces.
- Two unhelpful extremes:
  - “Screens are enemies” → constant control, fear.
  - “Screens are harmless” → no limits, rising worry.
- A middle role:
  - You are a guide.
  - Curious about what screens give to your child.
  - Clear about when screens are not okay.

**Exercise (short, for printing):**

Two questions with blank lines:

1. “How many hours do I use screens on a normal day?”  
2. “What is one small change I would like to try for myself?”

### Lesson 1.4 – Observation challenge (gamified)

**Learning goal:**  
Parent practices non-judgmental observation for 3 days.

**Challenge description:**

For the next 3 days:

- Do not change any rule.
- Just observe and note:
  - When your child asks for screens.
  - What they were doing before.
  - How you responded.
  - What happened next (calm, conflict, bargain).

You can provide a simple table for printing.

**Gamification:**

- When parent marks this challenge as “done” in the app:
  - unlocks “Observer” badge.

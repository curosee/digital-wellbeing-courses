### Lesson 1: Why Most Screen Rules Fail

**Learning Goal:** Identify the three most common mistakes parents make when setting screen rules — so you can avoid them.

You have probably set a screen rule before. Maybe more than once. Maybe it lasted a week. Maybe it lasted a day. You are not alone. Most parents cycle through screen rules the way people cycle through diets — hopeful at the start, defeated by Friday.

Screen rules fail for three predictable reasons. Understanding them puts you ahead of the game.

**Mistake 1: Rules without relationship.** If the first time you talk to your child about screens is when you are taking them away, you have lost before you started. Rules that arrive as punishments, without any prior conversation about *why*, feel arbitrary and unfair. Your child does not hear "I am protecting you." They hear "You are in trouble." The research on authoritative parenting is clear: structure works only when it is built on a foundation of warmth and communication.

**Mistake 2: Rules without rationale.** "Because I said so" might stop an argument, but it does not build understanding. Children and teens who understand the reason behind a rule are far more likely to follow it — and to internalize it when you are not watching. The AAP's 5 C's framework gives you a ready-made rationale: we are protecting your sleep, your health, your relationships, and your ability to enjoy life beyond a screen.

**Mistake 3: Rules without flexibility.** A screen plan that never changes is a screen plan that breaks. Your child grows. Their needs change. New apps emerge. School projects require more screen time. A rigid "two hours and that is it" rule cannot survive contact with real life. The best plans have clear principles but flexible application.

When you combine all three mistakes — no warmth, no explanation, no adaptation — you get the most common outcome: a cold-turkey crackdown that lasts a few days, followed by a return to the old patterns, followed by guilt, followed by another crackdown. The cycle is exhausting for everyone.

The good news is that the opposite of each mistake is simple. Warmth. Explanation. Flexibility. That is what you will build in this module.

**Exercise:** Think about the last screen rule you tried to set. Which of the three mistakes did it fall into? No judgment — just awareness. Write it down. You are going to do it differently this time.

**Key Takeaway:** Screen rules fail when they lack warmth, explanation, and flexibility. The fix is not stricter rules — it is smarter ones, built on relationship and rationale.

### Lesson 2: Warm, Firm, and Explained

**Learning Goal:** Apply the authoritative parenting model to screen management.

Decades of child development research point to one parenting style that consistently produces the best outcomes across virtually every measure — academic performance, emotional regulation, social skills, and yes, healthy technology use. It is called authoritative parenting.

Authoritative parenting has three ingredients:

**Warmth.** Your child feels loved, valued, and heard. They know that rules come from care, not control. You express affection. You listen to their perspective. You validate their feelings even when you disagree with their behavior.

**Structure.** There are clear, consistent boundaries. Your child knows what is expected. Consequences are predictable and proportionate. You follow through on what you say.

**Explained rationale.** You tell your child *why*. Not in a lecture. In a brief, honest explanation. "We are turning screens off an hour before bed because blue light and stimulating content make it harder for your brain to wind down. I want you to get the sleep you need."

This is different from permissive parenting (warm but no structure), authoritarian parenting (strict but no warmth or explanation), and uninvolved parenting (neither warmth nor structure).

Applied to screens, authoritative parenting looks like this:

- "I love that you enjoy gaming with your friends. That is real connection and I value it. We also need to protect your sleep, so gaming ends at 9 pm on school nights. Here is why sleep matters so much at your age..."
- "I know it feels frustrating when I ask you to put the phone away during dinner. Your feelings make sense. We keep dinner screen-free because it is our time to actually talk to each other. That matters to me."
- "You are old enough to have more input on how we handle screens. Let's figure this out together. But some things are non-negotiable, and I will explain why."

Notice the pattern: validate, set the boundary, explain the reason. This works better than any app timer because it builds the internal understanding your child needs to eventually manage screens on their own.

Emily Weinstein and Carrie James, researchers at Harvard's Project Zero and authors of *Behind Their Screens*, found that teens whose parents explained the reasoning behind digital rules were more likely to follow those rules and to develop their own healthy screen habits over time.

**Exercise:** Take one screen rule you already have (or want to have). Rewrite it using the authoritative model: warmth, structure, explained rationale. Practice saying it out loud. Notice how different it feels from "Because I said so."

**Key Takeaway:** Authoritative parenting — warm, firm, and explained — is the most effective approach to screen management. Your child needs to feel loved, know the boundary, and understand the reason.

### Lesson 3: Rules They Help Write

**Learning Goal:** Understand why involving your child in creating the screen plan dramatically increases compliance.

Here is a counterintuitive truth: the fastest way to get your child to follow screen rules is to let them help write them.

This feels risky. If you let your child set the rules, will they just give themselves unlimited screen time? Actually, no. Research on collaborative rule-making consistently shows that children and teens who participate in setting limits are more likely to follow them, more likely to understand the reasoning, and more likely to hold themselves accountable when parents are not watching.

Why does this work? Three reasons.

**Ownership.** When your child has a say in the rules, the rules become partly theirs. It is harder to rebel against something you helped create. The psychology of ownership is powerful — we value and protect things we have a hand in building.

**Fairness.** Children have a deep sense of justice. When rules are imposed from above without input, they feel unfair — even if they are reasonable. When children contribute to the process, they experience the rules as fair, which makes compliance feel less like submission and more like agreement.

**Skill-building.** The act of negotiating screen rules teaches self-regulation, perspective-taking, and critical thinking. These are exactly the skills your child needs to eventually manage screens without your help. You are not just creating a plan — you are building a capability.

Now, collaboration does not mean democracy. You are still the parent. Some things are non-negotiable — like no screens in bedrooms at night, or content restrictions for younger children. But within those non-negotiables, there is room for your child's input on questions like: Which shows or games? What time does screen time start? What happens if someone breaks the agreement? How do we handle special occasions?

Devorah Heitner, in *Screenwise*, calls this the difference between being a "screen police officer" and being a "digital mentor." A police officer enforces rules from the outside. A mentor walks alongside, guides decision-making, and gradually hands over more autonomy as trust is earned.

For younger children (under 8), this might look like giving them a choice between two acceptable options: "Would you like to watch your show before or after your bath?" For tweens, you can involve them more fully: "Let's sit down together and figure out our screen plan for school nights." For teens, the conversation should feel genuinely collaborative: "I have some concerns I want to share. I also want to hear your perspective. Let's work this out."

**Exercise:** Think about your child's age. How much input is appropriate for their developmental stage? Write down two or three areas where you could invite their participation in the screen plan — and one or two non-negotiables that stay firm regardless.

**Key Takeaway:** Children who help write the rules are more likely to follow them. Collaboration is not weakness — it is smart parenting that builds the self-regulation skills your child will need for life.

### Lesson 4: Your Family Screen Agreement

**Learning Goal:** Create a written Family Screen Agreement using a step-by-step process.

It is time to put it all together. A written agreement works better than verbal rules because it is concrete, visible, and shared. Nobody can claim they forgot what was decided.

Here is a step-by-step process for building your Family Screen Agreement:

**Step 1: Set the tone.** Begin the conversation by telling your child that this is something the family is doing together — not something being done *to* them. Mention your own screen habits and your willingness to be part of the agreement. This is not a child behavior contract. It is a family commitment.

**Step 2: Identify the non-negotiables.** These are the things you as the parent decide, with explained rationale. Common non-negotiables include: devices out of bedrooms at night, no screens during meals, age-appropriate content limits, and time limits for younger children. Keep this list short and focused on what research shows matters most.

**Step 3: Invite input on everything else.** Ask your child: When should screen time happen? How much feels reasonable on school nights versus weekends? What happens when someone breaks the agreement? How should we handle exceptions (sleepovers, holidays, sick days)? Let them propose ideas. Negotiate genuinely.

**Step 4: Include yourself.** Add your own commitments. Maybe you will stop checking your phone during dinner. Maybe you will keep your phone out of the bedroom too. Maybe you will limit your own social media use. When parents include themselves, the agreement gains credibility.

**Step 5: Write it down.** Keep it simple — one page. Use clear, specific language. "Screens off by 8:30 pm on school nights" is better than "reasonable screen time in the evening." Put it on the refrigerator, the family bulletin board, or wherever it will be seen.

**Step 6: Sign it.** Everyone signs. This is symbolic but powerful. It says: we all agreed to this. We are all accountable.

**Step 7: Set a review date.** Build in a time to revisit the plan — two weeks from now is a good start. Plans need to evolve. Putting a review date on the agreement from the beginning normalizes adjustment.

The AAP offers a free Family Media Plan tool on their website that can help structure this process. Common Sense Media also provides a Family Media Agreement template. Use whatever format works for your family — the process matters more than the template.

**Exercise:** Set a time this week to sit down with your family and begin drafting your agreement. Even if you only complete Step 1 and Step 2, you have started. Progress, not perfection.

**Key Takeaway:** A written Family Screen Agreement — with clear non-negotiables, collaborative input, parental commitments, and a review date — is the cornerstone of screen-smart family life.

---

### Module 1 Challenge: Draft Your Family Screen Plan

**Using the template from Lesson 4, draft a Family Screen Agreement with input from your child. It does not need to be perfect — it needs to exist. Write it, discuss it, and put it somewhere everyone can see.**

Set aside 30 to 45 minutes for this conversation. Prepare by reviewing your notes from the *Why Is My Kid Glued to That Screen?* course — especially your Family Screen Map and 5 C's assessment.

Your agreement should include:
- Non-negotiable rules (with reasons)
- Collaboratively agreed screen times and limits
- Device-free zones and times
- Parental commitments (your own rules for yourself)
- Consequences for breaking the agreement (agreed upon by everyone)
- A review date (two weeks from now)
- Signatures from all family members

Pin it up. Take a photo. This is your family's screen plan, version 1.0.

# Module 2: Age by Age

## What works for toddlers, kids, tweens, and teens

---

### Lesson 1: The Tiny Ones (0-5)

**Learning Goal:** Implement evidence-based screen strategies for babies, toddlers, and preschoolers.

If you have a child under five, you are in the most critical window for screen habits. Not because damage is inevitable, but because the brain is doing its most intensive wiring during these years. What you put in front of your child — and what you do not — shapes neural pathways that will last.

Here is what the research says:

**Under 18 months:** The AAP and WHO are aligned — no screen time except video calls with loved ones. At this age, babies learn through face-to-face interaction, physical touch, and sensory exploration. Screens cannot provide what a parent's face, voice, and responsiveness offer. Video chatting is the exception because it involves a live, responsive human on the other end.

**18 to 24 months:** If you choose to introduce screens, stick to high-quality, educational programming and watch together. Co-viewing at this age is essential because toddlers learn more from screens when an adult is narrating, asking questions, and connecting what they see to the real world. A toddler watching alone gets very little from the experience.

**2 to 5 years:** The AAP recommends no more than one hour per day of high-quality programming, co-viewed whenever possible. "High-quality" means educational, age-appropriate, and ad-free — programs from PBS, Sesame Workshop, and similar sources. The difference between a curated educational show and algorithm-driven YouTube content is enormous at this age.

Only 25% of children under 2 currently meet screen time guidelines. If your family is in the other 75%, you are in good company. The point is not guilt — it is awareness and gradual change.

Practical strategies for the little ones:

- Create a short list of approved shows or apps and stick to it
- Watch together whenever you can — talk about what you see
- Use a visual timer so your child can see when screen time ends
- Build screen time into a predictable routine (after lunch, before bath) so it has a beginning and an end
- Have alternative activities ready for when the screen goes off — blocks, crayons, books, outdoor play
- Avoid using screens as the default calming tool; build a diverse "calming toolbox" that includes physical comfort, music, breathing, and movement

The key insight for this age group: content and context matter more than minutes. A child watching Daniel Tiger with a parent who talks about the show is having a fundamentally different experience than a child passively watching random YouTube videos alone.

**Exercise:** If you have a child under 5, audit their current screen diet. What do they watch or play? Who chose it? Do you watch together? Write down what you find and identify one change you could make this week.

**Key Takeaway:** For children under 5, quality and co-viewing matter more than counting minutes. Protect this critical developmental window with high-quality content, shared viewing, and plenty of screen-free play.

---

### Lesson 2: The Middle Years (6-9)

**Learning Goal:** Navigate the expanding digital world of school-age children with clear guardrails and growing trust.

The middle years bring a shift. Your child starts using screens for homework. They may get their first device — or start borrowing yours more often. Friends talk about games and videos they have seen. The digital world gets bigger, and your ability to control every interaction with it gets smaller.

This is normal. And it is manageable.

At this age, the AAP recommends consistent limits that protect sleep (9 to 12 hours per night for 6-to-12-year-olds), physical activity (at least 60 minutes per day), homework time, and in-person social interaction. There is no single magic number for screen time. The question is whether screens are crowding out the essentials.

Key strategies for ages 6 to 9:

**Start media literacy early.** Children at this age are ready to begin understanding that not everything online is true, that ads are trying to sell them things, and that people sometimes present only the best parts of their lives. You do not need a formal curriculum. Just talk about it: "Why do you think that ad showed up?" or "Do you think that person's life is always this exciting?"

**Keep screens in shared spaces.** A computer in the living room is much easier to monitor casually than a tablet in a bedroom. This is not about surveillance — it is about presence. You want to be available for questions and to notice if something upsets your child.

**Use content filters and parental controls — but do not rely on them.** No filter catches everything. And an over-reliance on technology to parent creates a false sense of security. Filters are a safety net, not a replacement for conversation.

**Talk about what they see.** Children this age will encounter things that confuse, scare, or excite them online. Create an environment where they feel safe telling you about it. If they tell you about something inappropriate and your first response is to take the device away, they will learn not to tell you next time. Heitner's mentoring approach says: respond with curiosity, not punishment.

**Start the concept of "screen time choices."** Give your child a daily or weekly screen time budget and let them choose how to spend it. This builds decision-making skills and prevents the feeling that every minute is controlled by you.

This is the age where you are laying the groundwork for the harder conversations ahead. A child who trusts you with small things at age seven will be more likely to come to you with big things at age thirteen.

**Exercise:** Have a five-minute conversation with your child about something they watched or played recently. Ask what they liked about it, what surprised them, and if anything confused them. Listen more than you talk. This builds the communication habit you will need later.

**Key Takeaway:** Ages 6 to 9 are about building habits, starting media literacy, keeping screens in shared spaces, and creating an environment where your child feels safe talking to you about what they see online.

### Lesson 3: The Tween Shift (10-12)

**Learning Goal:** Prepare for the unique challenges of the tween years — when social media arrives and peer pressure intensifies.

The tween years are when the ground shifts under your feet. One day your child is watching cartoons. The next, their friends are on Instagram. They want a phone. They want privacy. They want to be like everyone else.

This is also the age when research shows the most vulnerability. Jean Twenge's data reveals that the association between screen time and mental health problems is larger among adolescents than younger children. Jonathan Haidt's work emphasizes that the transition from "play-based childhood" to "phone-based childhood" typically happens between ages 10 and 14.

Here is what you are navigating:

**The social media question.** Most social media platforms officially require users to be 13 — but 40% of children ages 8 to 12 use social media anyway. You will face pressure from your child: "Everyone has it." That pressure is real. So is the research suggesting that early social media use, especially passive scrolling and social comparison, is associated with worse mental health outcomes.

You have options. You can hold the line at 13 (or later). You can allow supervised access to certain platforms. You can explore alternatives designed for younger users. There is no single right answer, but there is a right process: talk with your child about *why* you are making the decision you are making, listen to their perspective, and revisit the decision as they mature.

**The phone question.** When should your child get a smartphone? Haidt recommends not before age 14. Many families choose earlier. If you do give a phone, consider starting with a basic phone (calls and texts only) or a phone with parental controls that you relax over time as trust is earned. The key principle: give access gradually, tied to demonstrated responsibility.

**The privacy question.** Tweens want more privacy. This is developmentally normal and healthy. But privacy is not the same as secrecy. You can respect your child's growing need for autonomy while maintaining agreed-upon check-ins. Heitner's framework distinguishes between "monitoring" (watching over their shoulder, which breeds distrust) and "mentoring" (guiding them with regular, respectful conversations).

**The body image issue.** Research shows that 77.6% of adolescent females report body image issues linked to social media. Platforms like Instagram and TikTok are designed around visual comparison. If your tween is starting to engage with these platforms, have honest conversations about filters, editing, and the difference between curated images and real life.

**Exercise:** If your child is a tween, ask them this question: "If you could have any phone or app in the world with no rules, what would you choose — and why?" Their answer will tell you a lot about what they want, what their peers are doing, and what matters to them. Use it as a starting point for a collaborative conversation.

**Key Takeaway:** The tween years are when social media, phones, and peer pressure arrive. Navigate them with honest conversation, gradual trust-building, and clear principles rather than rigid rules or total restriction.

### Lesson 4: The Teen Tightrope (13-18)

**Learning Goal:** Shift from control to coaching as your teenager develops digital autonomy.

If you are parenting a teenager, you already know this: you cannot control their screen use anymore. Not really. They have their own phone. They have hours when you are not present. They know how to clear a browser history. Trying to control everything is a losing game — and it damages your relationship.

The shift from control to coaching is the hardest transition in digital parenting. But it is also the most important one.

Coaching means:

**You stay informed, not in control.** You know what platforms they use. You have general awareness of their online social life. You have occasional, genuine conversations about what is happening — not interrogations. Emily Weinstein's research at Harvard found that teens are more likely to seek parental guidance when parents approach with curiosity rather than surveillance.

**You focus on principles, not policing.** Instead of monitoring every app, you teach your teen to ask themselves: "Is this making my life better or worse? Am I choosing this, or am I on autopilot? Would I be comfortable if someone I respect could see this?" These questions travel with them when you cannot.

**You respect their growing autonomy.** Teens need to make some of their own mistakes. Not all mistakes — you still intervene for safety. But a teenager who chooses to stay up too late scrolling and feels terrible the next day has learned something real about consequences. A teenager whose parent confiscates the phone every night at 9 pm has learned that someone else manages their life for them.

**You keep the door open.** The most protective factor during the teen years is relationship. If your teenager trusts you enough to come to you when something bad happens online — cyberbullying, unwanted contact, seeing something disturbing — that trust is worth more than any parental control app.

The AAP deliberately avoids specific time limits for teenagers. Instead, they recommend ensuring that screen use does not interfere with sleep (teens need 8 to 10 hours), physical activity, academic performance, and in-person relationships. If those are healthy, the exact number of screen hours matters less.

Practical strategies for teens:

- Negotiate screen boundaries rather than imposing them
- Encourage them to track their own screen time and reflect on it
- Support their interests — even digital ones — while asking good questions
- Model the behavior you hope to see (keep working on your own habits)
- Maintain non-negotiables around safety (no sharing personal information with strangers, no sexting, telling an adult if they feel unsafe)
- Have conversations about digital reputation, privacy, and the permanence of online content

**Exercise:** If your teenager is willing, try this: ask them to teach you something about their favorite app or game. Let them be the expert. Watch how the dynamic shifts when you approach with genuine curiosity instead of suspicion.

**Key Takeaway:** With teenagers, shift from controlling to coaching. Stay informed, teach principles, respect autonomy, and above all, keep the relationship strong. A teen who trusts you is safer than a teen who is monitored.

### Module 2 Challenge: The Age-Appropriate Update

**Revisit your Family Screen Plan with age-specific adjustments based on what you learned in this module. For each child, note what changes and why.**

Pull out your Family Screen Agreement from Module 1. For each child in your family:

1. Review the age-specific guidance from this module
2. Identify one thing in your current plan that needs to change based on their developmental stage
3. Identify one thing that is already age-appropriate and working well
4. Write down the adjustment and the reason behind it

If you have children at different ages, your plan may need different rules for each child — and that is fine. Fairness does not mean identical rules. It means appropriate rules for each individual child. Explain this to your children using the "Child" from the 5 C's framework: different kids have different needs.

# Module 3: When They Push Back

## Handling resistance without losing your cool

---

### Lesson 1: The Meltdown Moment

**Learning Goal:** Understand why removing screens triggers such intense emotional reactions in children — and respond effectively.

The screen goes off. Your child melts down. They scream. They cry. They say something cutting. You feel your blood pressure rise. Maybe you yell back. Maybe you give in. Either way, nobody feels good about what just happened.

Here is what is going on in your child's brain during that moment.

The intensity of the reaction is real — it is not just drama. When your child is engaged with a screen, their brain is receiving a steady flow of dopamine-driven stimulation. When you turn the screen off, that stimulation stops abruptly. The brain's pleasure-pain seesaw (remember Lembke's model?) tips toward the pain side. Your child experiences a mini version of withdrawal: irritability, frustration, restlessness, and sometimes genuine distress.

For younger children, this is compounded by their still-developing prefrontal cortex — the brain region responsible for impulse control and emotional regulation. They literally do not yet have the neural hardware to manage the transition smoothly every time.

For older children and teens, the social dimension adds fuel. If they were in the middle of a game with friends or a group chat, turning off the screen feels like being pulled out of a social situation. Imagine someone physically removing you from a conversation with your friends. The frustration is understandable.

None of this means you should avoid setting limits. It means you should expect resistance and prepare for it — rather than being surprised and derailed by it.

Some immediate strategies for the meltdown moment:

- **Give warnings.** "You have ten minutes left" and then "Five minutes" gives the brain time to prepare for the transition. Abrupt shutdowns create bigger reactions.
- **Validate the feeling.** "I know it is frustrating to stop when you are in the middle of something." Validation is not permission. It is acknowledgment.
- **Have something next.** The transition from screen to nothing is harder than the transition from screen to something. "Screens off, but we are making pizza together" is easier to accept than "Screens off, go find something to do."
- **Stay calm.** Your calm is the most powerful tool in the room. If you escalate, they escalate. If you stay steady, the storm passes faster.

**Exercise:** Think about the last time your child had a meltdown when a screen was taken away. With what you now know about the brain's response, can you see the experience differently? Write down one thing you might do differently next time.

**Key Takeaway:** Screen meltdowns are neurologically real, not just bad behavior. Warnings, validation, having something next, and staying calm are your best tools for navigating these moments.

### Lesson 2: Plan B Parenting

**Learning Goal:** Apply Ross Greene's Collaborative and Proactive Solutions (CPS) to recurring screen conflicts.

If you find yourself having the same screen fight over and over, it is time for a different approach. Punishment is not working. Yelling is not working. Even your carefully written screen agreement might not be covering this particular conflict.

Ross Greene, a clinical psychologist at Harvard Medical School and author of *The Explosive Child*, developed an approach called Collaborative and Proactive Solutions (CPS). It was originally designed for children with behavioral challenges, but it works beautifully for screen conflicts in any family.

Greene identifies three plans:

**Plan A:** The parent imposes their will. "Turn it off now." This works in emergencies but creates resentment when overused. It also does not teach your child how to solve problems.

**Plan C:** The parent drops the expectation for now. Sometimes this is strategic — you choose your battles. Not every screen issue needs to be addressed today.

**Plan B:** The collaborative approach. This is where the magic happens.

Plan B has three steps:

**Step 1: Empathy.** Start by understanding your child's concern or perspective. "I have noticed that it has been really hard for you to stop gaming when it is time for dinner. Help me understand what is going on." Then *listen*. Really listen. Do not jump to solutions. Ask follow-up questions. "Tell me more." "What makes it so hard to stop at that point?"

**Step 2: Define the Problem.** Share your concern — without blame. "My concern is that when you game right up until dinner, you come to the table frustrated and the meal does not go well for anyone. And sometimes dinner gets cold." Now both perspectives are on the table.

**Step 3: Invitation.** Invite your child to solve the problem with you. "I wonder if there is a way we can figure this out so that you do not feel yanked out of your game and dinner still happens on time. Do you have any ideas?"

The power of Plan B is that your child becomes a problem-solver instead of an opponent. Solutions they help create are solutions they actually follow. And the process itself teaches critical skills: empathy, perspective-taking, negotiation, and compromise.

Plan B works best proactively — not in the heat of the moment. Choose a calm time to have the conversation, not the moment your child is mid-meltdown.

**Exercise:** Identify one recurring screen conflict in your home. Write down: (1) Your child's perspective — what do you think they would say if you really listened? (2) Your concern — what is the impact you are worried about? (3) Two or three possible solutions that might address both perspectives. You are preparing for a Plan B conversation.

**Key Takeaway:** Ross Greene's Plan B — Empathy, Define the Problem, Invitation — transforms screen conflicts from power struggles into collaborative problem-solving. Solutions your child helps create are solutions they follow.

### Lesson 3: Scripts That Actually Help

**Learning Goal:** Have ready-to-use responses for the most common things children say during screen conflicts.

Every parent knows these lines. "Everyone else gets to." "You are the strictest parent ever." "You do not understand." "It is not fair." "I hate you."

These statements are designed — consciously or not — to make you doubt yourself, feel guilty, and back down. Having a calm, prepared response makes all the difference.

Here are scripts for the most common pushbacks:

**"Everyone else gets to!"**
Response: "I hear you, and I know it feels that way. Some families have different rules, and that is okay. In our family, we made this agreement together, and here is why it matters to us. If you think the rule needs to change, let's talk about it at our next check-in — not right now."

**"You do not understand!"**
Response: "You might be right. Help me understand. What am I missing? I really want to hear your perspective."

**"It is not fair!"**
Response: "Fair does not always mean the same. Your younger brother has earlier bedtime rules, but he also has earlier screen limits. Fair means each person gets what they need for their age. What specifically feels unfair to you?"

**"I need my phone for school!"**
Response: "You are right that some schoolwork happens on screens. Let's separate school use from recreational use. During homework time, the phone stays on the desk with only the apps you need for school. Social media and games can wait until homework is done."

**"You are always on your phone too!"**
Response: "That is a fair point, and I am working on it. You are right that I need to follow the same principles I am asking of you. Hold me accountable."

**"I hate you!"**
Response: (Deep breath.) "I love you even when you are angry with me. This rule is not going away, but your feelings are okay. We can talk more when things feel calmer."

The common thread in all of these: stay calm, validate the feeling, hold the boundary, and offer a path forward. You do not need to win the argument. You need to survive it with the relationship intact.

**Exercise:** Choose the pushback you hear most often from your child. Practice the response script out loud — by yourself or with a partner — three times. Rehearsal makes it easier to access in the heat of the moment.

**Key Takeaway:** Prepared responses help you stay calm and consistent during screen conflicts. Validate the feeling, hold the boundary, and offer a path forward. You do not need to win the argument — you need to survive it with the relationship intact.

---

### Lesson 4: Staying Calm When They Are Not

**Learning Goal:** Manage your own emotional triggers during screen-related conflicts so you can respond instead of react.

Here is the truth nobody talks about: the hardest part of managing your child's screen use is managing your own emotions about it.

When your child has a meltdown over screens, it triggers something in you. Maybe it is fear — fear that you are failing as a parent, that screens are harming your child, that you are losing control. Maybe it is guilt — guilt about how much screen time you have allowed, or about your own phone habits. Maybe it is anger — at the tech companies, at your child's defiance, at yourself.

Whatever it is, when you react from that triggered state, things get worse. You yell. You make threats you do not follow through on. You say something you regret. Or you give in because you cannot handle the fight anymore.

Your calm is the most important tool in the room. Not calm as in "never feel angry." Calm as in "feel the anger and choose how to respond anyway."

Practical strategies for staying regulated:

**The pause.** When you feel the heat rising, pause for five seconds before you respond. Just five seconds. Breathe in. Breathe out. Those five seconds create space between the trigger and your response. That space is everything.

**Name what you feel.** Silently label it: "I am feeling angry right now." or "This is guilt." Research on affect labeling shows that naming an emotion reduces its intensity. You do not have to act on it — just name it.

**Lower your voice.** When someone is yelling at you, the instinct is to yell louder. Do the opposite. Speak more quietly. This forces your child to quiet down to hear you, and it signals that you are in control.

**Leave the room if you need to.** "I need a moment. I will be back in two minutes." This is not giving up. This is modeling exactly what you want your child to learn to do — taking a break when emotions are running high.

**Repair after rupture.** If you do lose your cool — and you will, because you are human — come back and repair. "I yelled earlier and I am sorry. I was frustrated, and I handled it badly. Let me try again." This teaches your child that relationships can survive conflict, and that taking responsibility is a sign of strength.

**Exercise:** Think about the last time a screen conflict escalated beyond what was helpful. What were you feeling in that moment? What triggered that feeling? Write down one strategy from the list above that you will try next time.

**Key Takeaway:** Your calm is the most powerful tool in any screen conflict. When you manage your own emotional triggers, you model the self-regulation you want your child to develop.

### Module 3 Challenge: The Plan B Conversation

**Choose one recurring screen conflict in your home. Use Ross Greene's Plan B approach (Empathy, Define the Problem, Invitation) to have a collaborative conversation with your child about it. Write down how it went.**

Pick a time when everyone is calm. Not during or right after a conflict. Choose the issue you prepared for in Lesson 2.

Follow the three steps:
1. **Empathy:** "I have noticed [the issue]. Help me understand what is going on from your side." Listen. Ask follow-up questions. Do not argue.
2. **Define the Problem:** "The thing I am concerned about is [your concern]. So we have two concerns here — yours and mine."
3. **Invitation:** "I wonder if we can find a solution that works for both of us. What ideas do you have?"

After the conversation, write down:
- What your child said that surprised you
- What solution you agreed on
- How confident you both are that it will work
- When you will check back in on it

This does not have to go perfectly. The fact that you are having the conversation is the win.

# Module 4: Screens and Sleep, School, and Sanity

## Protecting what matters

---

### Lesson 1: The Sleep Thief

**Learning Goal:** Understand the specific mechanisms by which screens disrupt your child's sleep — and implement practical protections.

If you take away one thing from this entire course, let it be this: protect your child's sleep from screens. Sleep is the foundation that everything else rests on — mood, learning, physical health, emotional regulation, and resilience. When sleep goes, everything else follows.

The research is stark. Between 2010 and 2021, the percentage of 10th and 12th graders sleeping seven or fewer hours per night rose from one-third to nearly one-half. Screens are a major driver.

How do screens steal sleep? Three mechanisms:

**Blue light.** Screens emit blue-spectrum light that suppresses melatonin production — the hormone that signals your brain it is time to sleep. Exposure to blue light within two hours of bedtime delays sleep onset and reduces sleep quality. Night mode and blue-light filters help, but they do not eliminate the effect.

**Stimulating content.** A fast-paced game, a dramatic video, a heated group chat — these activate the brain at exactly the time it should be winding down. The arousal persists after the screen is off. Your child lies in bed with a buzzing brain.

**The expectation of response.** For tweens and teens, the awareness that a message might arrive creates a state of vigilance. Even with the phone face-down on the nightstand, the knowledge that a notification could come keeps the brain on partial alert. Research shows that this expectation alone delays sleep onset and causes nighttime awakenings.

The most effective strategy is also the simplest: all devices out of the bedroom at least 30 minutes before bedtime. Ideally an hour. Create a family charging station in a common area. Everyone — including parents — charges their phone there overnight.

If your child uses their phone as an alarm clock, buy a ten-dollar alarm clock. That excuse should not cost them hours of sleep.

Other evidence-based sleep protections:
- Establish a consistent screen-off time that allows for a wind-down routine
- Replace screen time before bed with reading, conversation, or audio content
- Use built-in screen time features to auto-disable apps at a set time
- Keep TVs out of children's bedrooms — the presence of a TV in the bedroom is independently associated with shorter sleep duration

**Exercise:** For one week, move all devices out of bedrooms 30 minutes before bedtime — including your own. Track whether bedtimes change, whether anyone sleeps better, and how much resistance you encounter. Write down what you observe.

**Key Takeaway:** Screens steal sleep through blue light, stimulating content, and the expectation of notifications. The single most effective change you can make is getting devices out of bedrooms before bedtime.

### Lesson 2: Screen-Proofing Homework Time

**Learning Goal:** Create a focused homework environment that minimizes digital distraction.

Your child sits down to do homework on their laptop. Twenty minutes later, you walk by and they are on YouTube. You remind them to focus. They switch back. Five minutes later, they are on a different tab. This cycle can go on for hours, turning 30 minutes of homework into a three-hour ordeal.

This is not a character flaw. It is a design problem. The same device your child uses for homework is also a portal to infinite entertainment. Expecting them to resist that temptation through willpower alone is like expecting them to do homework in a candy store without eating anything.

Research on attention fragmentation shows that constant switching — even brief glances at social media — significantly reduces the quality of cognitive work. It is not just about the time spent on distractions. Each switch forces the brain to re-orient, costing precious cognitive resources.

Practical strategies for screen-proofing homework:

**Separate the tools.** If possible, use a dedicated device for schoolwork — a laptop or tablet that does not have social media, games, or entertainment apps installed. If that is not possible, use website blockers during homework time. Apps like Cold Turkey, Freedom, or the built-in Focus modes on most operating systems can temporarily disable distracting sites.

**Phone in another room.** During homework time, the phone goes somewhere else. Not face-down on the desk — actually in another room. Out of sight is out of mind. Studies show that even the *presence* of a smartphone on the desk reduces cognitive capacity, even when it is off.

**Set a timer.** The Pomodoro technique — 25 minutes of focused work, then a 5-minute break — works well for many children. During the 25 minutes, no distractions. During the break, they can check their phone if they want. This makes the restriction feel temporary and manageable.

**Create a homework ritual.** Same time, same place, same routine. The brain learns to associate that time and place with focus. Rituals reduce the number of decisions your child has to make about what to do next.

**Acknowledge the difficulty.** "I know it is hard to focus when your phone is right there. That is not a weakness — it is how brains work. These strategies help your brain do what it already wants to do." Normalizing the struggle reduces shame and increases cooperation.

**Exercise:** This week, try one new homework distraction strategy with your child. Discuss it with them first — explain why and get their input on which approach they want to try. After a week, check in: did it help?

**Key Takeaway:** Expecting children to resist digital distraction through willpower alone is unrealistic. Separate the tools, remove the phone, and create a focused homework environment.

### Lesson 3: Protecting Family Time

**Learning Goal:** Establish device-free zones and rituals that strengthen family connection.

Family dinners, car rides, bedtime routines, Saturday mornings — these are the moments that build family identity and connection. They are also the moments most vulnerable to screen intrusion.

A phone on the dinner table — even if nobody is looking at it — changes the quality of conversation. Research on "the iPhone effect" showed that the mere presence of a phone during a face-to-face conversation reduced the depth and quality of the interaction. People discussed less meaningful topics and reported lower empathy.

Device-free family time is not about being anti-technology. It is about being pro-connection.

Start with two foundational screen-free zones:

**Meals.** Dinner is the easiest place to start because it has a clear beginning and end. All devices — including yours — go in a basket or another room during meals. The conversation will be awkward at first, especially with teens. That is okay. Awkward silence is better than parallel scrolling. It will improve.

**Bedrooms at night.** As discussed in the sleep lesson, devices out of bedrooms before bed protects both sleep and the quiet, reflective time that children need to process their day.

Beyond these foundations, consider:

**Car rides.** Some of the best conversations with children happen in the car, because you are side by side rather than face to face. Less intense. Easier for kids to open up. But not if everyone is on a screen. Try screen-free car rides, even short ones.

**The first and last 30 minutes.** The first 30 minutes after your child wakes up and the last 30 minutes before they sleep are powerful windows. Screen-free mornings and evenings create bookends of connection around the day.

**One weekly ritual.** Choose one screen-free activity per week that the whole family does together. It does not have to be elaborate — a board game, a walk, cooking together, a card game. Consistency matters more than creativity.

The replacement principle applies here: you are not just removing screens from these moments. You are filling those moments with something better. Connection. Conversation. Shared experience. Play.

**Exercise:** Choose one meal this week to make completely device-free — for everyone, including parents. Put phones in a basket in another room. After the meal, write down one thing someone said that you might have missed if you had been on your phone.

**Key Takeaway:** Protecting family time from screens is not anti-technology — it is pro-connection. Start with meals and bedrooms, then build from there. Fill the screen-free moments with something better.

### Lesson 4: The Replacement Principle

**Learning Goal:** Understand why removing screens without adding something better always fails — and learn to build a rich life beyond screens.

"Less screens" is not a destination. It is a void. And voids get filled — usually with more screens.

This is the replacement principle: you cannot just subtract screen time. You have to add something in its place. The families who successfully reduce screen use are not the ones with the strictest rules. They are the ones with the fullest lives.

Think about it from your child's perspective. You take away the thing that gives them entertainment, social connection, mastery, and escape. What do you offer instead? If the answer is "nothing" or "go play outside" (with no friends available, no equipment, and no plan), your child will find their way back to a screen within minutes. And they will resent you for the void.

The replacement principle asks: what can we add that meets the same needs screens are meeting?

If screens meet the need for **belonging**, what offline social activities can you support? Playdates, clubs, team sports, family game nights?

If screens meet the need for **mastery**, what offline challenges can you provide? Musical instruments, building projects, cooking, art, coding with physical electronics?

If screens meet the need for **escape**, what healthy escape options exist? Books, audiobooks, creative play, time in nature, physical activity?

If screens meet the need for **fun**, what genuinely fun alternatives are available? This is the hardest one, because screens set a high bar for instant entertainment. But boredom itself is not the enemy — boredom is the doorway to creativity. Research shows that children who experience manageable boredom develop stronger self-directed play skills over time.

Practical approaches:

- Stock your home with materials for screen-free activities (art supplies, books, puzzles, sports equipment, board games)
- Schedule one new family activity per week — something different that nobody has tried before
- Support your child's offline interests with the same enthusiasm you would give to their screen interests
- Accept that the transition will involve boredom and complaints. It gets better. The brain needs time to recalibrate.
- Do not make everything educational — fun for the sake of fun counts

**Exercise:** For each of your child's top three screen activities, brainstorm one offline alternative that meets a similar need. Do not worry about whether it is a "perfect" replacement. Just identify options. Then pick one and try it this week.

**Key Takeaway:** Removing screens without adding something better creates a void that fills itself with more screens. The replacement principle says: for every screen activity you reduce, add an offline activity that meets the same underlying need.

### Module 4 Challenge: The Screen-Free Zone Experiment

**Establish one new screen-free zone or screen-free time in your home this week. Commit to it for seven days. Track what happens — both the resistance and the unexpected benefits.**

Choose one of these (or create your own):
- Screen-free dinner every night for seven days
- Screen-free bedrooms starting tonight
- Screen-free first 30 minutes of the morning
- Screen-free car rides
- One screen-free evening per week (for the whole family)

Rules for the experiment:
1. Everyone participates — including parents
2. Have a replacement activity ready (not just "no screens")
3. Expect resistance on days one and two — it usually gets easier by day four
4. Track your observations daily: What was hard? What was surprisingly good? What did you notice?
5. At the end of seven days, decide together: keep it, adjust it, or try a different zone

Write down your observations each day, even just a sentence or two. This data will help you decide what to keep.

# Module 5: The Weekly Reset

## Keeping your plan alive

---

### Lesson 1: Plans Die on Monday

**Learning Goal:** Understand why screen plans lose momentum — and what sustains them.

You created a Family Screen Agreement. You had the conversations. Everyone signed it. And then life happened. The plan started strong. By the second week, enforcement got inconsistent. By the third week, the agreement was buried under a stack of mail on the kitchen counter.

This is normal. Plans die because life is messy, because willpower is finite, and because habits are strong. But the solution is not a better plan — it is a better process for keeping the plan alive.

Research on habit change shows that the critical factor in long-term success is not the initial commitment. It is the review cycle. Organizations that review their plans regularly outperform those that set goals and forget them. Families are no different.

The screen plan does not need to be perfect. It needs to be reviewed.

Why do plans lose momentum? Several reasons:

**Inconsistency.** You enforce the rules Monday through Wednesday, but by Thursday you are tired and let things slide. Your child learns that the rules are negotiable if they just wait long enough.

**Life disruptions.** A school holiday, a sick day, a weekend with grandparents — any change in routine can derail the plan. Without a mechanism for getting back on track, the disruption becomes the new normal.

**Evolving needs.** Your child is growing. What worked last month may not work this month. A plan that does not adapt becomes irrelevant.

**Loss of motivation.** The initial urgency fades. You get used to the current pattern, even if it is not ideal. Without a regular reminder of *why* you made the plan, the reasons fade.

The antidote to all of these is simple: a weekly check-in. Ten minutes. Same time every week. This single habit is the difference between a plan that works and a plan that dies on Monday.

**Exercise:** Look at your Family Screen Agreement. Is it where you can see it? Has it been followed this week? If not, what got in the way? Write down the one biggest barrier to consistency in your home.

**Key Takeaway:** Screen plans do not fail because they are bad plans. They fail because they are not reviewed. A regular check-in is the habit that keeps everything else alive.

### Lesson 2: The 10-Minute Check-In

**Learning Goal:** Implement a simple weekly family conversation that keeps your screen plan on track.

The Weekly Reset is a 10-minute conversation that happens at the same time each week. That is it. No special preparation. No worksheets. Just a short, structured conversation.

Here is the format:

**Minute 1-3: What worked this week?** Start positive. What went well? Did someone follow the agreement particularly well? Was there a great screen-free moment? Did a replacement activity turn out to be fun? Celebrate the wins, however small.

**Minute 4-6: What did not work?** Be honest. Where did the plan break down? What was hard? Listen to everyone's perspective — including the children. This is not a blame session. It is a diagnostic session. "The homework distraction strategy did not work because..." is more useful than "You broke the rules again."

**Minute 7-9: What should we adjust?** Based on what worked and what did not, does anything in the plan need to change? Maybe the screen-off time needs to shift by 30 minutes. Maybe a new app needs to be addressed. Maybe the plan worked perfectly and nothing changes. All of those outcomes are fine.

**Minute 10: Commitment for the coming week.** Each family member states one thing they will focus on this week. It can be small. "I will keep my phone out of the bedroom." "I will try the Pomodoro technique for homework." "I will not check my phone during dinner." One small commitment per person, spoken aloud.

When should you hold this check-in? The best time is one that is already anchored to something you do. Sunday evening after dinner. Saturday morning during breakfast. Friday after school. Pick a time and make it consistent.

Some families find it helpful to have a designated "check-in snack" — a special treat that only comes out during this conversation. It sounds small, but positive associations help habits stick.

**Exercise:** Choose a day and time for your first Weekly Reset. Write it on the calendar. Tell your family it is happening. Keep it to 10 minutes — use a timer if needed. After the check-in, write down the key points: one win, one challenge, one adjustment, and each person's commitment.

**Key Takeaway:** A 10-minute weekly check-in — what worked, what did not, what changes, one commitment each — is the single most powerful habit for sustaining your family screen plan.

---

### Lesson 3: Adjusting Without Caving

**Learning Goal:** Learn how to evolve your screen rules over time without abandoning the foundation.

There is a fine line between flexibility and caving. You need to know the difference.

Flexibility looks like this: "We said screens off at 8:30 on school nights, but you have been consistently responsible and your sleep is good. Let's try 9:00 and see how it goes."

Caving looks like this: "You are screaming and I am tired and fine, just take the tablet, but only for 10 minutes." (Which becomes 30. Which becomes an hour.)

Flexibility is planned, thoughtful, and based on evidence. Caving is reactive, emotional, and based on exhaustion. Both result in the rules changing, but one builds trust and the other destroys it.

How to adjust without caving:

**Tie changes to the review cycle.** When your child asks for a rule change, your default response should be: "That is a good point. Let's discuss it at our check-in this weekend." This prevents in-the-moment negotiation and channels requests into the structured process.

**Require evidence.** Before changing a rule, ask: what has changed? Has your child demonstrated responsibility? Has the situation shifted? Are there new needs? Changes based on evidence are adjustments. Changes based on pressure are concessions.

**Expand gradually.** Devorah Heitner's mentoring model suggests giving more digital freedom in small increments, tied to demonstrated trustworthiness. If your teen handles 9:00 screen-off responsibly for two weeks, maybe 9:30 is the next step. If they immediately push it to 10:30, you go back to 9:00. The message: freedom is earned and maintained through responsibility.

**Maintain non-negotiables.** Some things should not change regardless of how much your child lobbies. Devices out of bedrooms at night. No social media access for young children. Age-appropriate content restrictions. Safety boundaries. These are the pillars. Everything else can flex.

**Explain when you hold firm.** "I hear that you want to change this rule. Here is why I am not ready to change it yet. Let's revisit in a month and see where things are." This is not "because I said so." It is "here is my reasoning, and the door is not closed forever."

**Exercise:** Look at your Family Screen Agreement. Identify one rule you would be willing to adjust if your child demonstrates responsibility over the next two weeks. Tell them about it. "If [specific behavior] goes well for two weeks, I am open to changing [specific rule]."

**Key Takeaway:** Adjusting rules over time is healthy and necessary. The key is to make changes deliberately — through the review process, based on evidence, and tied to demonstrated responsibility — rather than reactively caving to pressure.

### Lesson 4: Celebrating Progress, Not Perfection

**Learning Goal:** Build a family culture that recognizes wins, normalizes setbacks, and sustains motivation over the long term.

You are going to have bad weeks. Your child is going to break the agreement. You are going to break it too. Someone will have a meltdown. Someone will sneak a phone into their bedroom. You will get busy and skip the Weekly Reset for three weeks in a row.

All of this is normal. All of this is part of the process.

The families who succeed with screen management over the long term are not the ones who follow the plan perfectly. They are the ones who recover from lapses gracefully. They celebrate progress. They forgive setbacks. They keep showing up.

Here is what celebrating progress looks like:

- Noticing and naming the wins. "You put your phone down without being asked today. I noticed that." Small acknowledgments land big.
- Measuring against your own starting line, not someone else's ideal. If your family went from 5 hours of daily screen time to 3.5 hours, that is meaningful — even if someone online says 2 hours is the "right" number.
- Treating setbacks as information, not failure. "We fell off the plan this week. What happened? What can we learn from it?"
- Using the Weekly Reset to stay accountable without shame. The check-in is a restart button, not a scorecard.

And here is what self-compassion looks like for you as a parent:

- Recognizing that you are parenting in an unprecedented time. No previous generation had to navigate smartphones, social media, and algorithmic feeds with their children. You are making the road as you walk it.
- Forgiving yourself for past screen decisions. You did the best you could with the information you had. Now you know more, and you are doing better.
- Asking for support. Talk to other parents. Share what is working and what is not. You are not alone in this.

The goal was never perfection. The goal was awareness, intention, and gradual improvement. You have all three.

**Exercise:** Write down three screen-related wins from the past month — however small. Share them with your family. Then write down one setback and what you learned from it. This is the mindset that sustains change over the long term.

**Key Takeaway:** Perfection is impossible and unnecessary. Celebrate progress, treat setbacks as learning opportunities, and keep showing up. That is all it takes.

---

### Module 5 Challenge: Your First Weekly Reset

**Hold your first 10-minute family screen check-in using the template from Lesson 2. Ask what is working, what is not, and what should change. Write down the outcome and schedule the next one.**

Gather the family. Set a timer for 10 minutes. Follow the format:

1. **What worked this week?** (2-3 minutes) — Everyone shares a win.
2. **What did not work?** (2-3 minutes) — Everyone shares a challenge.
3. **What should we adjust?** (2-3 minutes) — Discuss one change to the plan.
4. **One commitment each.** (1-2 minutes) — Each person states one focus for the coming week.

After the check-in:
- Write down the key points
- Schedule the next check-in (same day, same time, next week)
- Put the next date on the calendar where everyone can see it

You have now built the habit that keeps everything else working. Repeat weekly. Adjust as needed. This is how Screen-Smart Families stay screen-smart.

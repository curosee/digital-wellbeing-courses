  Create a practical, action-oriented slide deck for parents titled "Screen-Smart Families." The tone is warm and encouraging — like a parenting coach who has seen it all. Use clean, structured design with warm colors. Include a visual Family Screen Agreement template, age-by-age guideline graphics, Ross Greene's Plan B conversation flow chart, and a Weekly Reset checklist. Show diverse family structures. Emphasize collaboration over control. Each module gets its own section. End with the Weekly Reset habit as the key sustainable practice.

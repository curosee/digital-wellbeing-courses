### Lesson 1: Beyond Heavy Use — When It Becomes a Disorder

**Learning goal**: Understand the clinical criteria that distinguish heavy screen use from a diagnosable disorder, using the DSM-5 and ICD-11 frameworks.

There is a difference between someone who uses screens a lot and someone whose screen use has become a disorder. That difference matters. It matters because it changes what kind of help is needed. It matters because it validates what you have been feeling. And it matters because naming something accurately gives you power to address it.

The American Psychiatric Association included Internet Gaming Disorder in the DSM-5 as a condition warranting further study. The criteria include: preoccupation with gaming, withdrawal symptoms when gaming is taken away, tolerance (needing to spend increasing amounts of time gaming), unsuccessful attempts to control gaming, loss of interest in previous hobbies and activities, continued excessive use despite knowing the psychosocial problems it causes, deceiving family members or others about the amount of gaming, using gaming to escape or relieve negative moods, and jeopardizing or losing a significant relationship, job, or educational opportunity because of gaming. Five or more of these in a twelve-month period suggest the presence of the disorder.

The World Health Organization went further in 2019, including Gaming Disorder in the ICD-11 — the international classification used by most countries for diagnosis. The ICD-11 criteria focus on three core features: impaired control over gaming, increasing priority given to gaming over other life interests and activities, and continuation or escalation of gaming despite negative consequences. These patterns must be present for at least twelve months, though the period can be shorter if symptoms are severe.

While these criteria focus specifically on gaming, researchers and clinicians increasingly apply similar frameworks to other forms of compulsive screen use — social media, streaming, pornography, and general internet use. The underlying pattern is the same: loss of control, increasing priority, and continuation despite harm.

You are not a clinician. You cannot and should not diagnose anyone. But understanding these criteria gives you a framework for assessing what you are seeing. It moves the conversation from "I think there is a problem" to "There are specific, recognized patterns, and several of them are present."

**Exercise**: Read through the DSM-5 criteria listed above. Without trying to diagnose, note which ones you have observed in the person you love. This is for your own clarity, not for confrontation.

**Key takeaway**: Clinical criteria exist that distinguish heavy use from a disorder. Understanding them gives you clarity and credibility when you need it most.

### Lesson 2: The Red Flags Checklist

**Learning goal**: Identify specific behavioral red flags that indicate screen use has moved into dangerous territory, beyond what the clinical criteria alone describe.

Clinical criteria give you a framework. But the day-to-day reality often shows up in more immediate, visible ways. These are the red flags — the warning signs that something has gone seriously wrong.

Compulsive use. They cannot stop even when they want to. They promise to get off in five minutes and two hours pass. They set their own limits and break them. This is not forgetfulness. It is loss of control.

Withdrawal symptoms. When the screen is unavailable — due to a power outage, a broken device, a confiscated phone — they become agitated, anxious, irritable, or depressed. These are not just bad moods. They are withdrawal responses, and they look the same whether the substance is chemical or digital.

Neglecting responsibilities. School, work, household tasks, hygiene, health — things they used to manage are falling apart. Not because they do not care, but because the screen has taken priority over everything else.

Sleep disruption. Staying up until 2, 3, 4 a.m. Sleeping through the day. Using screens in bed as a barrier to sleep. Sleep disruption is both a symptom and an accelerant — poor sleep worsens mood, which increases the pull toward screens, which further disrupts sleep.

Social withdrawal. Pulling away from friends, family, and activities they used to enjoy. Their social world is increasingly or exclusively online. In-person connection feels difficult or uninteresting.

Deception. Hiding screen use. Lying about how much time they spend. Creating secret accounts. Using screens in the bathroom, in bed after you are asleep, during work hours. Deception signals awareness that the behavior is a problem — and an inability to stop despite that awareness.

Mood dependence. Their emotional state is tightly linked to screen access. Up when they are online. Down when they are not. Using screens specifically to manage negative emotions, with decreasing ability to cope any other way.

These red flags do not all need to be present. Even two or three of them, sustained over time, warrant serious attention.

**Exercise**: Go through the red flags above. For each one, write yes, no, or sometimes. Be honest. This checklist is a tool for clarity, not a weapon.

**Key takeaway**: Red flags are the daily, visible signs that screen use has become dangerous. Recognizing them clearly helps you know what you are dealing with.

### Lesson 3: The Mental Health Connection

**Learning goal**: Understand the relationship between compulsive screen use and mental health conditions, including the evidence on depression, anxiety, and risk in adolescents.

Compulsive screen use rarely exists in isolation. It almost always coexists with other mental health challenges — sometimes as a cause, sometimes as an effect, and often as both in a self-reinforcing cycle.

Research published in JAMA Pediatrics and other leading journals has found that adolescents with compulsive screen use patterns face two to three times the increased risk of depression and anxiety compared to their peers. This is not a minor statistical finding. It means that the teen you are worried about is significantly more likely to be dealing with depression or anxiety alongside their screen use — and each condition makes the other worse.

The relationship is bidirectional. Someone who is depressed may turn to screens for relief, because screens reliably provide stimulation and distraction. But excessive screen use disrupts sleep, reduces physical activity, displaces face-to-face social interaction, and can expose the user to social comparison, cyberbullying, and other stressors — all of which deepen depression and anxiety.

This cycle is one of the reasons compulsive screen use is so hard to break without professional help. You are not just dealing with a screen habit. You may be dealing with a screen habit that is intertwined with depression, anxiety, social isolation, ADHD, trauma, or other conditions that need their own attention.

For adults, the picture is similar. Compulsive screen use in adults is associated with higher rates of depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, and relationship distress. The specific screens may differ — gaming, social media, pornography, streaming, news consumption — but the underlying pattern and the mental health connections are consistent.

This is important for you to understand because it changes the scope of what might be needed. This might not be something that a screen time agreement or a family conversation can fix. This might need professional help. And knowing that is not a defeat. It is a realistic assessment that opens the door to real solutions.

**Reflection**: Have you noticed signs of depression, anxiety, or other mental health challenges in the person you love — beyond the screen use itself? Changes in mood, appetite, sleep, motivation, social engagement? Write down what you have observed.

**Key takeaway**: Compulsive screen use is deeply intertwined with depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions. Addressing only the screen use without addressing the mental health rarely works.

### Lesson 4: Trust Your Gut, But Check the Facts

**Learning goal**: Balance your intuitive sense that something is wrong with an evidence-based assessment, giving yourself both emotional and factual ground to stand on.

You knew something was wrong before you read any of this. Your gut told you. The tightness in your chest. The worry that kept you up. The grief for the relationship or the person you remembered. That instinct is real and it is valuable.

But instinct alone can be dismissed — by the person you love, by well-meaning friends who tell you to relax, by your own self-doubt. That is why the facts matter. Not to replace your intuition, but to support it.

Now you have both. You have your lived experience of watching someone you love disappear into screens. And you have clinical criteria, red flag checklists, and research data that confirm what you have been feeling. These two sources of knowledge — the experiential and the empirical — together give you something solid to stand on.

This does not mean you march into the room and present a case. That would likely trigger defensiveness. But it means you can hold your concern with confidence. You are not overreacting. You are not being controlling. You are seeing clearly.

It also means you can make informed decisions about next steps. If you have identified multiple red flags and clinical criteria, it is reasonable to consider professional help. If the situation is less severe, the skills from the previous courses — listening, boundaries, invitations — may be sufficient. Knowing where you stand helps you calibrate your response.

Trust your gut. It brought you here. And now you have the facts to back it up.

**Exercise**: Write a brief summary — for yourself — of what you know. Include both your felt experience ("I feel worried because...") and the factual indicators ("I have observed these specific red flags..."). This summary is for you. It is your foundation.

**Key takeaway**: Your instinct and the evidence say the same thing. Together, they give you the confidence and clarity to take the next step.

---

### Module 1 Challenge: The Honest Assessment

Using the red flags checklist and the DSM-5/ICD-11 criteria from this module, honestly assess the person you are worried about. Go through each criterion and each red flag. Note which ones apply, which ones do not, and which ones you are unsure about. Count the ones that apply. Write down what you see. This is not a diagnosis — only a qualified professional can provide that. But it gives you a clear-eyed picture of where things stand, and it will help you decide what to do next. If the assessment confirms what your gut has been telling you, that is important information. Sit with it. Then move to the next module.

# Module 2: The Professional Help Conversation

## Suggesting therapy without shaming

---

### Lesson 1: Why Therapy Works for Screen Overuse

**Learning goal**: Understand the evidence-based treatments available for compulsive screen use, so you can speak about professional help with confidence and specificity.

When you suggest therapy, it helps to know what you are suggesting. Not in clinical detail, but enough to speak about it with confidence. Because "you should see someone" is vague and easy to dismiss. "There are specific therapies that have been shown to help people with exactly this pattern" is harder to ignore.

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT, is currently the most well-researched and effective treatment for compulsive screen and gaming use. CBT helps people identify the thoughts, feelings, and situations that trigger their screen use, develop alternative coping strategies, challenge distorted thinking (like "I can stop whenever I want" or "This is the only thing I enjoy"), and build new behavioral patterns. Research by Kimberly Young and others has demonstrated that CBT adapted for internet addiction produces significant reductions in use and improvements in mood.

Motivational Interviewing, which you have been learning about throughout this series, is often used alongside CBT. MI helps someone who is ambivalent about change — who knows something is wrong but is not ready to commit to changing — to explore their own motivations and move toward action. It is particularly effective early in the process, before someone is ready for the structured work of CBT.

For adolescents, family-based approaches show strong results. Research indicates that MI conducted with both the adolescent and parent together yields larger effect sizes than working with either alone. This makes sense: screen use does not happen in isolation. It happens in a family system. Treating the system produces better outcomes than treating the individual.

Other approaches that have shown promise include acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), mindfulness-based interventions, and, for gaming specifically, programs modeled on addiction treatment frameworks. Some specialized clinics and residential programs exist for severe cases.

The point is this: help exists. It is specific. It is researched. And it works. Knowing this gives you credibility when you raise the topic.

**Exercise**: Write down, in your own words, what you would say to the person you love about why therapy might help. Keep it brief — three to four sentences. Use what you learned here.

**Key takeaway**: Effective, evidence-based treatments for compulsive screen use exist. Knowing this transforms "you need help" into something specific, credible, and hopeful.

---

### Lesson 2: Overcoming the Stigma Barrier

**Learning goal**: Understand why the person you love might resist the idea of therapy, and learn to address that resistance with empathy rather than argument.

When you suggest therapy, expect resistance. Not because therapy is bad, but because the suggestion often lands like a verdict: "Something is wrong with you."

The stigma around mental health treatment has decreased in many places, but it is still significant — especially for certain populations. Young men, who make up a large proportion of people with gaming disorder, may view therapy as a sign of weakness. Adolescents may feel singled out or pathologized. Partners may interpret the suggestion as an accusation that they are broken or that the relationship is failing.

Understanding why they resist helps you respond to the resistance rather than being derailed by it. Common reasons include fear of being labeled. "If I go to therapy, that means I am an addict." This fear is understandable. You can address it by normalizing therapy as a tool, not a label. "Seeing a therapist does not mean there is something wrong with you. It means you are dealing with something hard and you deserve support."

Another reason is denial. "I do not have a problem." This is often a stage of change issue — they may be in precontemplation. Pushing harder will not help. Instead, plant a seed and wait. "I understand you see it differently. I just want you to know the option is there."

Another reason is shame. "If people found out..." Address this directly. Therapy is confidential. No one needs to know. And seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness.

And sometimes the resistance is practical. "I do not know how to find someone." "It costs too much." "I do not have time." These obstacles are real and addressable. You can help with research, logistics, and even financial planning — if they are open to it.

Your job is not to eliminate the resistance. It is to understand it, acknowledge it, and gently keep the door open.

**Reflection**: What resistance do you anticipate from the person you love? Write it down. For each point of resistance, write one compassionate response.

**Key takeaway**: Resistance to therapy is normal and understandable. Meeting it with empathy and patience — not argument — is what keeps the door open.

---

### Lesson 3: How to Bring It Up

**Learning goal**: Learn specific, tested approaches for suggesting professional help in a way that minimizes shame and maximizes the chance of a positive response.

This conversation is one of the most difficult you may ever have. And the way you approach it matters enormously. Here are strategies that work, drawn from Motivational Interviewing and clinical best practice.

Start with what you see, not what you think they need. "I have noticed you seem stressed lately" is better than "I think you need therapy." Describing observable behavior without diagnosing keeps the conversation safe.

Use "I" statements about your own worry. "I have been worried about you, and I care about you enough to bring this up even though it is uncomfortable." This frames the suggestion as an act of love, not a criticism.

Normalize the idea. "A lot of people go through something like this, and there are therapists who specialize in exactly this kind of thing." This reduces the sense of being singled out or pathologized.

Frame it as information, not instruction. "I came across some information about therapists who help with this. Would you be open to looking at it together?" This preserves their autonomy. They can say no. And preserving that option, paradoxically, makes them more likely to say yes.

Avoid ultimatums unless the situation is truly at a breaking point. "If you do not get help, I am leaving" may sometimes be necessary, but it should be a last resort, not an opening move. Ultimatums create pressure, and pressure creates resistance.

If the person is your child, consider suggesting a family counseling approach rather than individual therapy for the child alone. Framing it as "something we do together" removes the implication that they are the problem. And as the research shows, family-based MI is more effective anyway.

If they say no, do not panic. Say, "I understand. I just want you to know the option is there whenever you are ready." And mean it. The seed is planted.

**Exercise**: Write a brief script for how you would bring up therapy. Include an opening "I" statement, a normalizing sentence, and an offer to help with logistics. Practice it out loud.

**Key takeaway**: Suggest therapy as an act of love, not a verdict. Frame it as information. Preserve their autonomy. And if they say no, leave the door open.

---

### Lesson 4: Finding the Right Help

**Learning goal**: Know what to look for in a therapist or treatment program, and have practical steps for finding appropriate professional support.

If they say yes — or when they do — you want to be ready. Finding the right therapist can be the difference between a positive experience that leads to change and a negative experience that confirms their belief that therapy does not work.

Look for a therapist who has specific experience with behavioral addictions, internet or gaming overuse, or at minimum, experience with compulsive behaviors and CBT. General therapists may be excellent at many things but unfamiliar with the specific dynamics of compulsive screen use.

Questions to ask a potential therapist include: Do you have experience working with internet or gaming overuse? What approach do you use? (Look for CBT, MI, or ACT.) Do you work with families or just individuals? How do you measure progress? What does a typical treatment plan look like?

Where to look: Psychology Today's therapist finder allows you to search by specialty. Your primary care provider may have referrals. Organizations like Game Quitters, SMART Recovery, and the SAMHSA National Helpline can point you in the right direction. If you are in a rural area or cost is a barrier, telehealth options have expanded dramatically and can provide access to specialized therapists regardless of location.

For severe cases — especially where the person has stopped attending school or work, is experiencing significant mental health crises, or has been unable to change despite outpatient therapy — residential treatment programs exist that specialize in internet and gaming addiction. These are intensive and costly, but they can be life-changing for people in crisis.

One important note: therapy is not just for them. You may benefit enormously from your own therapist or from a support group for families of people with compulsive behaviors. SMART Recovery Family and Friends and similar programs offer structured support specifically for people in your situation.

**Exercise**: Spend thirty minutes researching therapists in your area or online who specialize in compulsive screen use. Write down three names, their specialties, and their contact information. If the person you love is ready, you are ready too.

**Key takeaway**: Finding the right therapist matters. Look for specific experience with behavioral addictions and evidence-based approaches. And do not forget to get support for yourself.

### Module 2 Challenge: The Research and the Conversation

Do two things this week. First, research three therapists or counselors who have experience with behavioral addictions, gaming disorder, or compulsive internet use. These can be local or telehealth. Write down their names, specialties, availability, and contact information. Second, draft a compassionate script for how you might suggest therapy. Use "I" statements. Normalize. Frame it as information, not instruction. Preserve their autonomy. Practice saying it out loud at least three times. You do not have to use it this week. But having both the resources and the words ready means you can act when the moment is right.

# Module 3: Different Relationships, Different Approaches

## Partner vs parent vs friend strategies

---

### Lesson 1: When It Is Your Partner

**Learning goal**: Understand the unique challenges and strategies for supporting a romantic partner whose screen use has become compulsive.

When the person you love is your partner, the screen use feels deeply personal. It is not just a behavior problem. It is a relationship problem. Every hour they spend on a screen instead of with you feels like a choice. A rejection. A statement about where you rank.

Research on technoference in romantic relationships confirms what you feel. Partner phubbing — choosing a phone over the person sitting in front of you — is associated with lower relationship satisfaction, higher conflict, greater depressive symptoms, and even lower life satisfaction for the person being phubbed. This is real harm. And it accumulates.

The challenge with a partner is that you are equals. You have no authority to impose rules. You cannot confiscate their device. You cannot set screen time limits. Your only tools are communication, boundaries, and influence — which, used well, are powerful enough.

Key strategies for partner relationships include having conversations during calm, connected moments — not in the heat of frustration. Using "I" statements that describe the impact on you and on the relationship. Setting boundaries that protect your own wellbeing and the relationship's health — such as screen-free mealtimes, screen-free bedtimes, and dedicated one-on-one time. Making requests rather than demands. "I would love to have dinner together without phones. Would you be willing to try that this week?" And being willing to attend couples therapy together. A skilled therapist can facilitate conversations that are too charged to navigate alone.

One critical point: do not sacrifice your own standards for the relationship to keep the peace. If their screen use is genuinely damaging the relationship and they are unwilling to address it, you have the right to say so — clearly, lovingly, and with consequences you are prepared to follow through on.

**Reflection**: What does the screen use cost your relationship specifically? Write down three concrete things you have lost. These are not grievances to weaponize. They are truths that deserve to be named.

**Key takeaway**: When your partner's screen use hurts the relationship, you have the right to name it, to set boundaries, and to ask for change. You are equals, and your needs matter as much as theirs.

---

### Lesson 2: When It Is Your Child

**Learning goal**: Navigate the complex balance of authority, care, and collaboration when your child's screen use has become compulsive.

When the person is your child, the dynamic is different in every way. You have authority. You have responsibility. You have a developmental perspective they do not. And you have a love so fierce it can make you do things that are well-intentioned but counterproductive.

The most common mistake parents make is relying solely on control — taking away devices, imposing strict time limits, monitoring every minute. Control feels like the obvious answer when you are scared for your child. But research consistently shows that unilateral control, especially with adolescents, produces resistance, deception, and damage to the parent-child relationship. It addresses the symptom while ignoring the cause and breaking the bridge you need to actually help.

Ross Greene's Collaborative and Proactive Solutions (CPS) model offers a better framework. CPS involves three steps, often called "Plan B." Step one: empathize. Seek to understand your child's perspective on their screen use. What do they enjoy? What needs does it meet? What concerns, if any, do they have? Use reflective listening. Do not dismiss or debate. Step two: share your concern. Clearly, briefly, and without lecturing. "I worry about your sleep." "I notice you seem less happy overall." Step three: collaborate. "Can we figure out something that works for both of us?" Involve them in creating the solution. When kids participate in creating rules, compliance increases dramatically.

Research on MI with adolescents is also instructive. Studies have found that MI conducted with both the parent and adolescent together produces larger effect sizes than working with either alone. This makes sense. The problem exists in the relationship. The solution needs to involve the relationship too.

If your child is younger — preteen — you have more room for direct structure. Age-appropriate limits, media plans, and parental controls are reasonable and supported by pediatric guidelines. But even with younger children, the spirit of collaboration matters. Explain the why behind the rules. Listen to their frustration. Adjust as they mature.

If your child is an older teen or young adult, your authority diminishes and your influence becomes everything. Here, the skills of MI — open questions, affirmations, reflective listening, summarizing — are your most powerful tools. You cannot force change in an 18-year-old. But you can create conditions where change becomes their idea.

**Exercise**: If your child is the person you are worried about, try a Plan B conversation this week. Start with empathy. Share your concern. Then ask, "What do you think we could do about this together?" Write down what happens.

**Key takeaway**: With children, collaboration works better than control. Seek to understand before being understood, and involve them in the solution.

---

### Lesson 3: When It Is a Friend or Sibling

**Learning goal**: Understand the unique limitations and opportunities of supporting a friend or sibling whose screen use concerns you.

When the person is a friend or sibling, you have the least structural power and, in some ways, the most relational power. You are not their parent. You are not their partner. You have no authority over them. But you may be the person they trust most. The person they will listen to precisely because you have no agenda other than caring about them.

The primary challenge with friends and siblings is knowing your place. You do not live with the daily consequences the way a partner or parent does. You see them less frequently. You may be uncertain whether you have the right to say anything at all. You may worry about damaging the friendship or the sibling relationship by bringing up something uncomfortable.

You do have the right. Caring about someone gives you standing to express concern. But the way you do it matters. Keep it brief. One honest, compassionate statement is worth more than a long intervention. "I have noticed you seem different lately, and I care about you. Is everything okay?" opens a door without forcing someone through it.

Share your observation, not your diagnosis. "I notice you are gaming a lot more than you used to" is an observation. "I think you are addicted to gaming" is a diagnosis, and it will shut the conversation down.

Offer presence, not solutions. "I am here if you want to talk" is often more valuable than "Here is what you should do." Friends and siblings are peers, and peer support works best when it feels like companionship rather than management.

If the person is your sibling and you live together, you may have more daily exposure to the problem. In this case, you might also involve parents or other family members. You do not have to carry this alone. Saying "I am worried about my brother/sister and I do not know what to do" to a parent or trusted adult is not betrayal. It is responsible concern.

Know your limits. You cannot save a friend or sibling. You can love them. You can be present. You can say what you see. And then you need to take care of yourself, because watching someone you care about struggle without being able to fix it is its own kind of grief.

**Reflection**: What is your specific concern about your friend or sibling? What would you want to say to them if you could say one thing without fear of damaging the relationship? Write it down.

**Key takeaway**: Friends and siblings support through presence, honesty, and compassion — not through control. Say what you see, offer your presence, and respect the limits of your role.

---

### Lesson 4: When Multiple Relationships Are Affected

**Learning goal**: Develop strategies for situations where one person's screen use is impacting an entire family or social circle.

Sometimes the problem does not stay contained. One person's screen overuse ripples outward, affecting the entire family or friend group. A teen's gaming disrupts the whole household. A partner's scrolling creates tension that the children absorb. A friend's withdrawal from the group changes the social dynamics for everyone.

When multiple relationships are affected, the temptation is to unite everyone against the person with the problem. To form an alliance. To stage an intervention. While this can sometimes be necessary in severe cases, it more often creates a dynamic of shame, isolation, and defensiveness that makes the problem worse.

A better approach is systemic. Think about the family or social group as a system. Everyone in the system is affected. Everyone has a role. And change in any part of the system affects the whole.

For families, this might mean having an honest conversation — not about the one person's screen use, but about how screens affect everyone in the family. "How are screens working for our family?" is a very different question than "What are we going to do about your gaming?" It distributes responsibility and invites collective problem-solving.

For friend groups, it might mean naming what has changed. "I miss when we used to hang out without everyone being on their phones." This is not about singling out one person. It is about naming a pattern that everyone contributes to, even if one person contributes more.

If you are considering involving multiple people in a conversation or intervention, do so with care. Make sure it comes from love, not frustration. Make sure the person at the center does not feel ambushed. And consider professional guidance — a family therapist can facilitate these conversations in ways that protect everyone involved.

**Exercise**: Map the ripple effect. Draw a simple diagram showing how the person's screen use affects each person in the family or friend group. Who is impacted? How? This systemic view can reveal patterns and opportunities you have not noticed.

**Key takeaway**: When screen overuse affects multiple relationships, think systemically. Invite collective problem-solving rather than targeting one person. Change in any part of the system affects the whole.

---

### Module 3 Challenge: Your Relationship Strategy

Based on the specific relationship you have with the person you are worried about — partner, parent, friend, sibling — write a one-page strategy. Include: the specific challenges of your relationship dynamic, the communication approaches that fit your role, the boundaries that are appropriate and enforceable, what kind of professional help might be relevant, and what support you will seek for yourself. This is your personalized roadmap. It is not carved in stone — you will revise it as things change. But having it written down gives you direction when emotions are high and clarity is low.

# Module 4: Your Own Recovery

## Healing from the toll of supporting someone

---

### Lesson 1: You Have Been Through Something Hard

**Learning goal**: Acknowledge and name the grief, anger, exhaustion, and loss you have experienced as a supporter, and give yourself permission to tend to those wounds.

We have spent much of this course series focused on what you can do for someone else. This module is entirely about you. Because you have been through something hard. And you deserve healing too.

Living with or loving someone whose screen use has become compulsive means you have experienced loss. The loss of connection. The loss of the relationship as you knew it. Perhaps the loss of the person as you knew them. The loss of peaceful evenings, of shared meals, of undivided attention, of feeling chosen. These losses are real even if the person is still physically present.

You may have experienced anger — at them, at the screens, at yourself for not being able to fix it, at a world that designed these technologies to be addictive. Anger is a natural response to helplessness. It is not a character flaw.

You may have experienced guilt. For feeling angry. For not doing enough. For doing too much. For wanting to give up. For not giving up. Guilt often accompanies love in difficult situations, and it is rarely deserved.

You may have experienced exhaustion. The kind that sleep does not fix. The kind that comes from months or years of vigilance, worry, negotiation, and heartbreak. Caregiver burnout is well-documented in research, and it applies to you even if you do not think of yourself as a caregiver.

Name what you have been through. Not to wallow in it. But because unnamed pain stays stuck. Named pain can begin to move.

**Reflection**: Complete these sentences honestly. "The hardest part has been..." "I have lost..." "I feel angry about..." "I feel guilty about..." "I am exhausted from..." Let yourself write without filtering. This is for you alone.

**Key takeaway**: You have been through something genuinely hard. Naming your pain is not self-pity. It is the beginning of healing.

---

### Lesson 2: Secondary Trauma and Supporter Burnout

**Learning goal**: Understand the psychological concepts of secondary trauma and supporter burnout, and recognize their signs in yourself.

There are clinical terms for what you may be experiencing. They matter because they validate that what you feel is not just "being upset." It is a recognized psychological response to prolonged stress.

Secondary traumatic stress refers to the emotional distress that results from close contact with someone who is suffering. Originally studied in therapists and first responders, it is now recognized in family members and close supporters as well. Symptoms include intrusive thoughts about the situation, avoidance of things that remind you of it, hypervigilance, emotional numbness, irritability, and sleep disruption.

Caregiver or supporter burnout is the state of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion that results from the prolonged demands of supporting someone with a chronic condition or compulsive behavior. Burnout manifests as feeling depleted, cynical, or detached. You may feel like you have nothing left to give. You may feel hopeless. You may feel like nothing you do matters.

These are not signs of weakness. They are predictable, documented responses to an unsustainable situation. And they need attention — not because you are broken, but because you are human and you have been carrying too much for too long.

Signs to watch for in yourself include persistent fatigue that does not improve with rest, loss of interest in things you used to enjoy, increased irritability or emotional flatness, withdrawal from your own friendships and social connections, physical symptoms like headaches, muscle tension, or stomach problems, difficulty concentrating, and a feeling of being trapped.

If you recognize several of these, please take them seriously. You are not "just stressed." You may be in burnout. And burnout requires real intervention — rest, support, boundaries, and often professional help.

**Exercise**: Review the signs of burnout listed above. Rate each one on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much you are experiencing it. Add up your total. This is not a clinical assessment, but it gives you a snapshot of where you stand.

**Key takeaway**: Secondary stress and supporter burnout are real, documented conditions. Recognizing them in yourself is not weakness. It is the first step toward recovery.

---

### Lesson 3: Rebuilding Your Own Life

**Learning goal**: Begin the process of reclaiming the interests, relationships, and identity you may have lost or neglected while focused on supporting someone else.

At some point, you may have stopped being yourself. Not all at once. Gradually. The hobbies fell away because you were too worried or too tired. The friendships faded because you did not have the energy. The things that made you you — your interests, your passions, your sense of purpose beyond this situation — got pushed to the margins.

Rebuilding your own life is not abandoning them. It is refusing to abandon yourself.

Start with identity. Who were you before this became the center of your world? What did you care about? What made you laugh? What gave you energy? Some of those things may still be there, waiting to be picked up again. Others may have changed — and that is fine. The goal is not to go backward. It is to remember that you are a whole person with a life that matters, independent of this situation.

Reconnect with people. The isolation that comes from supporting someone with compulsive screen use is ironic — you are losing connection to a screen, and you may also be losing connection to your own support network. Reach out. Call the friend you have not talked to in months. Accept the invitation you were going to decline. You need people, and people need you.

Invest in something just for you. Not something that improves the situation at home. Not something that models good behavior. Something purely for your own growth, joy, or fulfillment. A class. A project. A physical activity. A creative outlet. Something that, when you do it, reminds you that you have a life beyond this.

This is not selfish. This is survival. And it is also modeling something important: that a person's life should not revolve around managing someone else's behavior.

**Exercise**: Make a list of ten things that bring you joy or energy that have nothing to do with the person you are supporting. Circle three. Commit to doing at least one of them this week.

**Key takeaway**: Rebuilding your own life is not abandonment. It is reclamation. You are a whole person, and your life matters beyond this situation.

### Lesson 4: Getting Help for Yourself

**Learning goal**: Explore the specific support options available to you as a supporter — therapy, support groups, and community resources.

You have been learning how to help someone else get help. Now it is time to talk about getting help for yourself.

Individual therapy can be enormously valuable for supporters. A therapist gives you a space where the focus is entirely on you — your feelings, your needs, your healing. You do not have to justify your pain or compare it to the other person's struggle. You can be honest about your anger, your grief, your ambivalence, your exhaustion. A good therapist helps you process these feelings, develop coping strategies, and make decisions with clarity rather than desperation.

Look for a therapist who understands family systems, codependency, or the impact of a loved one's compulsive behavior. You do not necessarily need a screen addiction specialist. You need someone who understands what it is like to love someone who is struggling.

Support groups offer something therapy cannot — the experience of not being alone. Hearing another person say, "I know exactly what you mean" can break the isolation that is one of the most painful parts of being a supporter. SMART Recovery Family and Friends provides evidence-based support groups specifically for people who love someone with compulsive behaviors. Al-Anon, while designed for families of people with alcohol use disorders, uses principles that are directly applicable to anyone supporting a person with compulsive behavior.

Online communities can also provide support, though be mindful of quality. Look for moderated groups with a focus on healthy coping rather than venting or despair.

And do not underestimate the power of informal support. A trusted friend who will listen without judgment. A family member who understands the situation. A colleague who checks in on you. These connections sustain you in ways that formal support cannot replace.

**Exercise**: Choose one form of support and take a concrete step toward accessing it this week. Book a therapy appointment. Attend a support group meeting. Call a trusted friend and be honest about how you are doing.

**Key takeaway**: Getting help for yourself is not an indulgence. It is a necessity. You deserve the same quality of support that you are trying to give someone else.

### Module 4 Challenge: Your Recovery Plan

Write a personal recovery plan. This is not about the other person. This is about you. Include one thing you will do for your physical health — exercise, sleep, nutrition, a medical check-up. One thing for your emotional health — therapy, journaling, a support group, a daily practice of self-compassion. One relationship you will invest in — a friendship, a family connection, a community. And one interest or passion you will reclaim or begin — something that makes you feel alive, engaged, and purposeful. Put specific dates and actions on each item. Share your plan with someone who will hold you accountable. Then follow through. Your recovery is not optional. It is the foundation that makes everything else sustainable.

# Module 5: The Long Road

## Patience, hope, and sustainable support

---

### Lesson 1: Relapses Are Part of Recovery

**Learning goal**: Understand that setbacks are a normal, expected part of the change process, and learn to respond to them without losing hope.

If the person you love begins to change — reduces their screen time, starts therapy, re-engages with life — there will likely come a moment when they slip. They will binge-game for a weekend. They will fall back into old scrolling patterns. They will miss a therapy appointment. They will disappear into the screen again, and all of your hope will feel like it was misplaced.

It was not. Relapse is a normal part of recovery. It is so normal that the Stages of Change model includes it as an expected stage, not a failure. Research on behavior change — for substances, for screens, for any compulsive pattern — shows that the path to lasting change almost always includes setbacks.

This does not mean you should expect or accept permanent return to the old pattern. A slip is not the same as a collapse. A bad weekend is not the same as giving up. The distinction matters.

When a relapse happens, your response matters enormously. If you respond with anger, disappointment, or "I knew this would happen," you confirm their deepest fear — that they cannot change, and that your love is conditional on their performance. If you respond with compassion, realistic perspective, and renewed support, you give them something to stand on.

A helpful response sounds like: "I see that this has been a hard week. I know that does not erase the progress you have made." Or: "Setbacks are part of the process. What can I do to support you right now?" Or simply: "I am still here."

This does not mean you hide your own feelings. You can be disappointed and compassionate at the same time. You can feel frustrated and still choose a response that helps rather than harms. That is what you have been learning throughout this entire course series.

**Reflection**: How do you typically respond to setbacks — in yourself, in others? What response would you want from someone you love if you had a setback?

**Key takeaway**: Relapse is part of recovery, not proof of failure. Your response to a setback can either rebuild hope or confirm despair. Choose hope.

### Lesson 2: Celebrating Small Wins

**Learning goal**: Train yourself to notice and honor incremental progress, even when the overall situation is still difficult.

When you have been hurting for a long time, it becomes easy to see only what is wrong. The brain has a negativity bias — it pays more attention to threats and problems than to improvements and positives. This bias is amplified when you are stressed, exhausted, and watching for red flags.

But if you only see what is wrong, you will miss what is right. And what is right — even if it is small — matters. It matters because it is evidence of possibility. It matters because acknowledging it reinforces the behavior you want to see more of. And it matters because it sustains your own hope.

A small win might be: they put their phone down during dinner once this week. They asked you a question about your day. They went outside for an hour. They admitted, even briefly, that they might be using screens too much. They attended a therapy appointment. They seemed more present for ten minutes.

These are not the solution. But they are signs of life in a landscape that has felt barren. And in Motivational Interviewing, affirmations — genuine acknowledgments of positive change — are one of the most powerful tools available. When you say, "I noticed you were really present at dinner last night, and it meant a lot to me," you are doing two things. You are reinforcing the behavior. And you are keeping the relationship warm.

Be careful not to make affirmations sound conditional or backhanded. "You were so great at dinner — why can't you be like that all the time?" is not an affirmation. It is a criticism in disguise. A genuine affirmation has no "but" attached to it.

**Exercise**: This week, notice one small positive thing each day — in them, in the situation, or in yourself. Write it down. At the end of the week, read the list. Let it remind you that change, however slow, is happening.

**Key takeaway**: Small wins are evidence of possibility. Noticing them sustains your hope and reinforces the changes you want to see.

### Lesson 3: The Relationship After the Crisis

**Learning goal**: Begin to envision and work toward a healed relationship, understanding that recovery changes both people and the dynamic between them.

If things improve — if they reduce their screen use, get help, re-engage with life — you might expect to feel pure relief. And you will feel relief. But you may also feel other things that surprise you.

You may feel anger that you did not expect. Now that the crisis has eased, the emotions you suppressed to survive may surface. You may feel resentment for the time lost, the pain endured, the sacrifices made. This is normal. The crisis demanded that you set your feelings aside. Recovery gives you space to finally feel them.

You may feel distrust. Even as things improve, you may catch yourself watching, waiting for the relapse, afraid to let your guard down. This hypervigilance is a trauma response. It is your nervous system protecting you from being hurt again. It takes time to unlearn.

You may feel a need to renegotiate the relationship. The crisis changed both of you. You are not the same people you were before. The relationship cannot simply revert to its pre-crisis state. It needs to be rebuilt — with new understanding, new boundaries, new communication patterns, and new agreements about how you treat each other.

This rebuilding is both a challenge and an opportunity. You have both learned things through this experience — about yourselves, about each other, about what matters. Those lessons can become the foundation of something stronger than what existed before. Not automatically. But intentionally.

Couples therapy or family therapy can be valuable during this phase. A skilled therapist can help you navigate the complex emotions of recovery and rebuild trust, communication, and connection.

**Reflection**: If things improve, what do you want the relationship to look like? Not what it was before, but what it could become. Write down your vision. Share it, when the time is right, with the person you love.

**Key takeaway**: Recovery changes both people. The relationship needs to be rebuilt, not restored. That rebuilding can create something stronger than what came before.

### Lesson 4: You Were Always Enough

**Learning goal**: Reflect on your journey, honor what you have learned and who you have become, and carry forward the wisdom you have gained.

You started this journey worried, confused, and probably feeling very alone. You did not know what to do. You may have felt like you were failing. You may have wondered if there was something wrong with you for caring so much, for trying so hard, for not being able to fix it.

There was never anything wrong with you. You were always enough. Not because you had the answers — nobody has all the answers. But because you showed up. You chose to learn instead of just react. You chose to understand instead of just blame. You chose to tend to your own pain instead of only tending to theirs. You chose love over control. You chose patience over perfection.

That does not mean you were perfect. You lost your temper. You said things you regret. You fell into old patterns. You enabled when you meant to support. You controlled when you meant to help. That is being human. And part of being human in a hard situation is forgiving yourself for the ways you stumbled while doing your best.

You have gained wisdom through this experience that you did not ask for and would not have chosen. But it is yours now. The ability to listen deeply. The ability to hold two truths at once. The understanding that you cannot change another person but you can change the environment. The knowledge that boundaries are not walls but acts of love. The recognition that your own wellbeing is not optional.

Carry these things forward. They will serve you in every relationship for the rest of your life. And carry this too: the person who started this course series and the person finishing it are not the same. You have grown. You have changed. And that change — the one change you could always make — was always enough.

**Exercise**: Write a letter to the version of yourself who started this journey. Tell them what you have learned. Tell them what you want them to know. Tell them they are going to be okay.

**Key takeaway**: You were always enough. Not because you had all the answers, but because you kept showing up. That is the most powerful thing anyone can do.

### Module 5 Challenge: The Letter to Yourself

Write a letter to yourself — the person who started this journey worried, exhausted, and unsure what to do. Tell yourself what you have learned. About compulsive screen use. About communication. About boundaries. About yourself. Tell yourself what you are proud of — the conversations you tried, the boundaries you held, the self-care you practiced, the patience you sustained. Tell yourself what you will carry forward into whatever comes next. Then read it out loud. Let your own voice say these words to you. You have done hard, brave, important work. You have learned to be a wise ally — to someone else and to yourself. This letter is your witness. Keep it somewhere you will find it on the days when you need to remember how far you have come.

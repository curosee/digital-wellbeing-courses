  Create a serious but hopeful slide deck titled "The Wise Ally" for people supporting a loved one in crisis-level screen overuse. The tone should be that of a compassionate clinician — clear, honest, grounding, and warm. Use muted, dignified colors (deep navy, warm gray, soft gold accents). Include the DSM-5 and ICD-11 criteria as clean, readable checklists. Show the CBT model for internet addiction as a simple diagram. Include relationship-specific strategy templates for partner, parent, friend, and sibling dynamics. Dedicate a section to the supporter's own recovery with self-care visuals. Show diverse people and relationships. End with the "Letter to Yourself" reflection as a powerful closing. The deck should feel like a trusted guide for the hardest chapter of the journey — honest about the difficulty, unwavering in its hope.

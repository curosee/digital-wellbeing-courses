    - Help parents feel understood and less alone.
    - Show key ideas and tools from each module in a clear and calm way.
    - Encourage them to continue through the modules and to print the worksheets.

    Tone:
    - Warm, non-judgmental, practical.
    - Avoid fear-based language.
    - Focus on balance, not demonizing technology.

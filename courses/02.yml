  course_overview: |
    Create a complete slide deck for the course
    "Reclaim Your Attention: Healing Your Relationship With Screens"
    on the CuroSee platform.

    Audience:
    - Adults who feel stuck in compulsive phone or social media use.
    - They often feel tired, distracted, guilty, or ashamed about their screen habits.
    - They are not seeking a clinical diagnosis; they want practical help.

    Goals of the deck:
    - Give a calm, hopeful overview of how the course works.
    - Help learners see their patterns clearly without shame.
    - Introduce key ideas and practices from each of the four modules.
    - Encourage experimentation and self-compassion.

    Tone:
    - Compassionate, simple, realistic.
    - No moralising, no shaming.
    - Emphasize that attention is valuable and can be cared for.

    Structure (suggested slides):

    1. Title slide:
       - "Reclaim Your Attention"
       - Subtitle: "Healing Your Relationship With Screens"
       - Mention: "CuroSee – Digital Wellness"

    2–3. Problem & empathy:
       - Common patterns: endless scrolling, checking, late-night use.
       - Feelings: tiredness, anxiety, guilt, sense of losing time.

    4–6. Module 1 overview: Seeing Your Screen Habits Clearly
       - Concept: "too much" is about impact, not just hours.
       - Mapping the day into morning/afternoon/evening.
       - Classifying use as nutritious, neutral, or draining.
       - The 60-second pause experiment.

    7–9. Module 2 overview: Triggers and Emotional Loops
       - External vs internal triggers.
       - Loop: trigger → urge → behavior → relief → cost.
       - Identifying top loops and designing tiny alternatives.

    10–12. Module 3 overview: Routines and Friction
       - Protecting sleep and mornings.
       - Creating time blocks for focus and real rest.
       - Adding friction (moving apps, disabling auto-play, etc.).

    13–15. Module 4 overview: Relapse and Maintenance
       - Why relapse is normal in behavior change.
       - Reading bad days as feedback.
       - Creating an Attention Care Plan and a letter to future self.

    16–17. Practical elements
       - Mention printable mapping sheets and pocket aids.
       - Encourage small steps, not drastic all-or-nothing changes.

    Design guidelines:
    - Clean, calm visuals with good contrast for printing.
    - Minimal text per slide, clear headings and bullets.
    - Use simple icons: clock, brain, phone, heart, notebook.
    - Prefer simple diagrams over heavy data charts.

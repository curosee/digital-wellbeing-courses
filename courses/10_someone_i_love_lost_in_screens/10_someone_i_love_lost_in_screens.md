# Someone I Love Is Lost in Screens

## What You Need to Know (And What You Can Actually Do)

# Module 1: What You See vs What They Feel

## Understanding screen overuse from both sides

---

### Lesson 1: You Are Not Overreacting

**Learning goal**: Validate that your concern is real and that seeking help is a sign of strength, not overreaction.

You came here because something is wrong. You can feel it. The person you love is disappearing into a screen, and the space between you keeps growing. That feeling in your chest — the worry, the frustration, the sadness — is real. It is not dramatic. It is not controlling. It is love paying attention.

Maybe people have told you to relax. "Everyone is on their phone." "It is just games." "They will grow out of it." And maybe some of that is true for some people. But you know the person you love. You know what they were like before. You know the difference between enjoying technology and being consumed by it.

Here is what matters right now. The fact that you are here means you are already doing something brave. You are taking your own feelings seriously. You are seeking understanding instead of just reacting. That is not overreacting. That is the exact opposite.

Research consistently shows that the people closest to someone with compulsive screen use experience real distress. You may feel lonely in a room full of people. You may feel angry and then guilty for being angry. You may grieve the relationship or the person you remember. All of that is valid.

You do not need to have all the answers today. You do not even need to do anything yet. Right now, the most important thing is this: your concern matters. Your pain matters. And there are things you can learn and do that will help — not to control another person, but to take care of yourself and to be the kind of support that actually makes a difference.

**Reflection**: Write down the moment when you first thought, "Something is not right." What did you notice? How did it make you feel? There is no wrong answer here.

**Key takeaway**: Your worry is not overreaction. It is love that is paying attention. You belong here.

---

### Lesson 2: What It Looks Like From Where You Stand

**Learning goal**: Name the specific behaviors and patterns you are observing so you can move from a vague sense of worry to clear-eyed awareness.

Let us be honest about what you are seeing. Not to build a case against someone. Not to prove a point. But because naming what is happening gives you ground to stand on.

Maybe it is the hours. The screen goes on, and the world disappears. Meals get cold. Conversations get half-answers. Bedtime comes and goes. Maybe you watch them choose the screen over things they used to love — sports, friends, family dinners, walks, work, sleep.

Maybe it is the mood changes. They are fine when they are online, irritable when they are not. You have learned to tiptoe around the transition from screen to real life because it always seems to go badly. Perhaps you have seen them become defensive, secretive, or dishonest about how much time they spend.

Maybe it is what is disappearing. The eye contact. The laughter. The inside jokes. The plans you used to make together. You might feel like you are living with someone who is physically present but emotionally somewhere else entirely. Researchers call this "technoference" — when technology interferes with the quality of your relationship. If the person is a partner, you might recognize what the research literature calls "phubbing" — phone snubbing — the act of choosing a device over the person sitting right in front of you.

You do not need a diagnosis to know something is wrong. You do not need to measure screen time to the minute. What you see is enough to take seriously.

**Exercise**: Make a simple list of what you are observing. Stick to behaviors, not judgments. For example, "Stays up until 2 a.m. on their phone" rather than "Is addicted to their phone." This clarity will serve you later.

**Key takeaway**: Naming what you see — clearly, without judgment — is the first step toward understanding it.

### Lesson 3: What It Feels Like From Where They Sit

**Learning goal**: Begin to understand the internal experience of someone whose screen use has become compulsive, using the compensatory internet use model.

This might be the hardest lesson in this course. Because right now, you might be angry. Or exhausted. Or both. And here we are asking you to step into their shoes for a moment.

You do not have to agree with what they are doing. You do not have to excuse it. But understanding why someone uses screens compulsively will change how you respond to it — and that change in your response can open doors that anger and frustration keep closed.

A researcher named Daniel Kardefelt-Winther proposed something called the compensatory internet use model. The core idea is simple but powerful: people do not become lost in screens because screens are irresistible. They become lost in screens because screens meet real needs that are not being met elsewhere.

Those needs might be connection. Online, they might feel accepted in ways they do not feel in person. The needs might be competence. In a game, they can level up, master challenges, and feel capable in ways that their offline life does not provide. The needs might be escape. If they are dealing with anxiety, depression, loneliness, grief, or stress, screens offer a reliable way to numb the pain. The needs might be autonomy. In their screen world, they are in control. Nobody is telling them what to do or how to feel.

None of this means the screen use is healthy. But it means the screen use makes sense to them. It is solving a problem. Until the underlying problem is addressed, simply taking away the screen is like taking away a crutch from someone with a broken leg.

This is not about letting them off the hook. It is about understanding the hook.

**Reflection**: Can you think of a time in your own life when you used something — food, work, shopping, even exercise — to cope with pain or stress? What need was it meeting? This is not a comparison. It is a bridge to empathy.

**Key takeaway**: Compulsive screen use is usually a symptom, not the root problem. Understanding the needs behind the screen changes everything.

---

### Lesson 4: Two Realities, One Relationship

**Learning goal**: Learn to hold both your pain and their experience as simultaneously true, without one canceling out the other.

Here is where things get complicated. Your pain is real. Their struggle is real. And these two truths can coexist without competing.

You are allowed to be hurt by their absence. They are allowed to be struggling with something they do not fully understand. You are allowed to want your relationship back. They are allowed to be caught in a pattern they cannot easily break. Both things are true. Neither cancels the other out.

This is one of the hardest things about loving someone whose screen use has become a problem. The temptation is to pick a side. Either you are the victim and they are the villain, or they are the sick one and you should just be more understanding. But real relationships are not that simple. Real compassion — the kind that actually helps — holds both realities at once.

In the field of Motivational Interviewing, which we will explore much more in the next course, there is a concept called "developing discrepancy." It means helping someone see the gap between where they are and where they want to be. But that only works if they feel understood first, not attacked. And it only works if you are also honest about your own experience.

You do not have to choose between their pain and yours. You can say, "I love you, I see you are struggling, and I am also hurting." That is not a contradiction. That is the truth.

**Exercise**: Practice this sentence, out loud or in writing: "I believe you are struggling. I also need you to know that I am struggling too." You do not have to say it to them yet. Just let yourself feel what it is like to hold both truths.

**Key takeaway**: Both your pain and their struggle are real. Holding both truths at once is the foundation for everything that comes next.

### Module 1 Challenge: The Two-Column Letter

Take a piece of paper and draw a line down the middle. On the left side, write what you see and feel. Be honest. On the right side, try to write what they might be feeling and needing. Use what you learned about the compensatory internet use model. You do not have to show this to anyone. It is for you. It is a practice in holding two realities at once. When you are done, sit with it for a moment. Notice if anything surprises you.

# Module 2: Why They Can't Just Stop

## The science behind compulsive screen use

---

### Lesson 1: More Than a Bad Habit

**Learning goal**: Understand how repeated screen use can change the brain's reward system over time, making it genuinely difficult — not just inconvenient — to stop.

You have probably thought it at some point. "Why can't they just stop?" It seems so simple from the outside. Put the phone down. Close the laptop. Walk away from the game. Choose me. Choose us. Choose real life.

If it were that simple, they probably would have done it by now. Most people who struggle with compulsive screen use are not happy about it. Many of them feel shame, frustration, and helplessness. They know something is wrong. They just cannot seem to change it.

Here is why. The brain has a reward system that runs on a neurotransmitter called dopamine. When something feels good — food, connection, accomplishment — dopamine signals the brain to pay attention and do that thing again. This system evolved to help us survive. But modern technology has learned to hijack it.

Apps, games, and social media platforms are designed by teams of engineers and psychologists to trigger dopamine release as efficiently as possible. Variable rewards — the same principle behind slot machines — keep users coming back because the brain craves unpredictability. Sometimes you get a like. Sometimes you level up. Sometimes you get nothing. That randomness is what makes it so hard to disengage.

Over time, with heavy use, the brain adapts. It produces less dopamine in response to normal, everyday experiences. Things that used to feel good — a conversation, a walk, a meal together — start to feel flat. The brain has recalibrated. The screen becomes the most reliable source of reward. This is not a moral failing. It is neuroplasticity working against someone.

**Reflection**: Think about a time when you tried to change a deeply ingrained habit — eating, exercise, a thought pattern. How easy was it? What made it hard? This is not about excusing their behavior. It is about understanding the terrain.

**Key takeaway**: Compulsive screen use changes the brain's reward system over time. It is not a matter of willpower. It is a matter of wiring.

---

### Lesson 2: The Needs Behind the Screen

**Learning goal**: Apply the compensatory internet use model to identify what specific needs the person you love might be meeting through screen use.

We introduced this idea in Module 1, and now we go deeper. Because this concept — that screen use is compensating for unmet needs — is one of the most powerful things you can understand as a supporter.

Psychologists who study compulsive internet use have identified several core needs that screens commonly fulfill. Belonging and connection: online communities, multiplayer games, and social media can provide a sense of being seen, valued, and included. For someone who feels isolated, rejected, or different, this can feel like oxygen. Competence and mastery: games in particular offer clear goals, immediate feedback, and a sense of progression. For someone who feels stuck, unsuccessful, or inadequate in their offline life, this is deeply appealing. Autonomy and control: in a screen world, the user makes the choices. For someone who feels powerless in their relationships, work, or circumstances, this can feel liberating. Emotional regulation: screens are remarkably effective at numbing difficult emotions. Anxiety, depression, loneliness, boredom, anger — all of these can be temporarily quieted by immersion in a screen world.

The key word is "temporarily." Screens do not actually solve the underlying problem. They provide relief without resolution. And over time, the unmet needs grow larger while the capacity to meet them offline grows smaller.

This is why simply restricting access rarely works on its own. If you take away the screen without addressing what the screen was providing, the need does not disappear. It just becomes more painful. The person may find another escape, or they may experience significant distress.

Your role is not to diagnose their needs. But you can begin to notice patterns. Do they reach for the screen when they are stressed? Lonely? After a conflict? When they feel criticized? These observations will become valuable later.

**Exercise**: Over the next few days, notice when the person you love reaches for their screen. Without judging, try to identify what happened just before. Write down the trigger and your best guess about the need it might be meeting.

**Key takeaway**: Screens are not the problem. They are the solution to a problem. Understanding what that problem is changes the entire equation.

---

### Lesson 3: Tolerance, Withdrawal, and Escalation

**Learning goal**: Recognize the patterns of tolerance, withdrawal, and escalation that signal compulsive screen use has moved beyond heavy use into something more concerning.

You may have noticed a pattern. The amount of screen time that used to be enough is no longer enough. They play longer. They scroll later. They need more. This is tolerance — the brain requiring increasing amounts of a stimulus to achieve the same effect. It is the same process that occurs with substance use, and it is one of the hallmarks of compulsive behavior.

You may also have noticed what happens when the screen is unavailable. Irritability. Restlessness. Anxiety. Anger. Sadness. An inability to focus on anything else. A pull so strong it seems to override everything. This is withdrawal — the brain's protest when its primary source of reward is removed. It is not comfortable to watch. It can be frightening.

And you may have noticed escalation. What started as casual gaming becomes a need to play competitively. What started as checking social media becomes hours of scrolling. What started as watching a show becomes binge-watching through the night. The stakes go up. The time goes up. The investment goes up.

These three patterns — tolerance, withdrawal, escalation — are significant. They appear in the DSM-5 criteria for Internet Gaming Disorder and the ICD-11 criteria for Gaming Disorder. They are signals that something has shifted from a choice to a compulsion.

This does not mean you should diagnose your loved one. That is not your job. But recognizing these patterns helps you understand what you are dealing with. This is not laziness. This is not a phase. This is a brain that has learned to depend on screens in a way that is difficult to unlearn without support.

**Reflection**: Have you observed tolerance, withdrawal, or escalation in the person you love? Write down specific examples. This is not evidence to use against them. It is information that helps you understand.

**Key takeaway**: Tolerance, withdrawal, and escalation are signs that screen use has moved from a choice to a compulsion. Recognizing them helps you respond with understanding rather than frustration.

---

### Lesson 4: It Is Not About Willpower

**Learning goal**: Release the belief that the person you love could stop if they simply tried harder, and understand what this means for your approach.

This lesson might change your relationship. Because the belief that they could stop if they wanted to is one of the biggest sources of pain for supporters. It turns their behavior into a personal rejection. If they loved me enough, they would put the phone down. If they cared about this family, they would stop gaming. If they had any self-respect, they would get off social media.

But compulsive behavior does not work that way. The prefrontal cortex — the part of the brain responsible for impulse control, long-term planning, and decision-making — is literally less effective when the reward system has been hijacked. It is like trying to steer a car when the brakes are worn down. The intention might be there. The capacity is diminished.

This is especially important to understand if the person you love is an adolescent. The prefrontal cortex is not fully developed until the mid-twenties. Teenagers are working with an incomplete braking system while being exposed to some of the most compelling reward stimuli ever engineered. This does not excuse poor behavior. But it explains why "just stop" is not a realistic instruction.

Letting go of the willpower myth does not mean giving up. It means shifting your approach. Instead of asking, "Why won't they stop?" you can ask, "What would need to change for stopping to become possible?" That is a very different question. And it leads to very different actions.

You cannot change another person. That is one of the most painful truths in any relationship. But you can change the environment. You can change your own responses. You can change what you offer. And sometimes, those changes create the conditions for the other person to change themselves.

**Exercise**: Write down one belief about their screen use that you have been holding tightly. Something like "They could stop if they really wanted to" or "They choose the screen over me." Now, gently, try rewriting it. Not to excuse their behavior, but to see it more clearly. For example: "They are struggling with something that is hard to stop, and it is also hard for me."

**Key takeaway**: Compulsive screen use is not a willpower failure. Letting go of that belief opens the door to approaches that actually help.

---

### Module 2 Challenge: The Needs Detective

Without asking them directly yet, observe for one week and try to identify what needs their screen use might be meeting. Loneliness? Stress relief? Boredom? A sense of accomplishment? Escape from pain? Write down your best guesses, along with the specific moments that led you to those guesses. This is not about being right. It is about developing a compassionate curiosity that will serve you in everything that follows.

---

# Module 3: Your Pain Matters Too

## Taking care of yourself in this situation

---

### Lesson 1: The Toll Nobody Talks About

**Learning goal**: Recognize and name the emotional and physical toll of supporting someone with compulsive screen use.

Most of the conversation about screen overuse centers on the person using the screen. Their brain. Their behavior. Their habits. Their recovery. But what about you?

Living with or loving someone whose screen use has become compulsive takes a toll that is rarely acknowledged. Research on family members of people with behavioral addictions shows elevated rates of anxiety, depression, sleep disruption, and chronic stress. The supporters burn out. And because the problem is not widely recognized — because it is "just screens" — supporters often suffer in silence.

You may be experiencing some of these things. Loneliness, even when you are not alone. Resentment that you try to push down. Hypervigilance — always monitoring their screen time, always bracing for the next argument. A feeling of walking on eggshells. Guilt for feeling angry. Shame for not being able to fix it. Exhaustion from trying.

You might feel like the relationship has become one-sided. You are present, engaged, trying. They are somewhere else. The concept of technoference — technology-mediated interference in relationships — has been linked in research to lower relationship satisfaction, higher conflict, and greater depressive symptoms in partners. If this is a parent-child relationship, you may feel like you are losing your child to something you cannot compete with.

None of this makes you weak. It makes you human. And it is important to name it because unnamed pain has a way of leaking out sideways — as anger, as control, as withdrawal, as despair.

**Reflection**: How is this situation affecting you, specifically? Your sleep. Your mood. Your other relationships. Your ability to enjoy things. Write it down, honestly.

**Key takeaway**: The supporter's pain is real, measurable, and worthy of attention. You cannot pour from an empty cup.

---

### Lesson 2: Technoference and Phubbing — When Their Screen Hurts You

**Learning goal**: Understand the research on how a loved one's screen use directly damages relational connection and your own wellbeing.

There is a growing body of research on what happens to relationships when screens come between people, and it validates what you already know in your gut.

The term "phubbing" was coined to describe the act of snubbing someone in favor of a phone. Studies have found that partner phubbing is associated with lower relationship satisfaction, higher levels of depression, and reduced feelings of life satisfaction. When the person who is supposed to be closest to you consistently chooses a screen over your face, your voice, your presence — it hurts. And the hurt is cumulative.

Technoference — the everyday intrusions and interruptions of technology in relationships — has been studied extensively by researcher Brandon McDaniel and his colleagues. Their findings are striking. Even small, repeated interruptions from devices during conversations, meals, and shared time erode the sense of being valued. You do not need a dramatic confrontation for damage to occur. The slow drip of interrupted moments is enough.

For parents watching a child disappear into screens, the pain is different but equally real. You may feel rejected by the very person you are trying to protect. You may feel helpless watching them disengage from the family, from school, from friendships. Research published in JAMA Pediatrics has found that teens with compulsive screen use patterns face two to three times the risk of depression and anxiety. You are not imagining the danger. The data supports your concern.

If the person is a partner, you may feel replaced. If the person is a friend, you may feel abandoned. If the person is a sibling, you may feel invisible. The relationship dynamics differ, but the underlying wound is similar: you are reaching for someone who is not reaching back.

**Exercise**: Think about a recent moment when you felt the impact of their screen use on your connection. Describe it in a few sentences. What happened? What did you feel? What did you need in that moment? This is practice in honoring your own experience.

**Key takeaway**: Research confirms that a loved one's excessive screen use directly harms your wellbeing and your relationship. You are not being oversensitive. The data is on your side.

---

### Lesson 3: The Codependency Trap

**Learning goal**: Recognize patterns of codependency that can develop when supporting someone with compulsive screen use, and understand how these patterns harm both of you.

When you love someone who is struggling, a natural instinct is to try harder. Monitor more. Fix more. Control more. You start organizing your life around their problem. Checking their screen time. Hiding devices. Creating rules. Negotiating. Bargaining. Losing sleep over it.

And slowly, without realizing it, their problem becomes the center of your world.

This is the codependency trap. It is a well-documented pattern in relationships where one person has a compulsive behavior. The supporter's identity becomes intertwined with managing the other person's problem. Your mood depends on their screen time. Your day is good when they were "good" and bad when they were "bad." You start to lose track of your own needs, your own interests, your own life.

Codependency is not love, although it feels like love. It is a way of coping with helplessness by trying to control the uncontrollable. And it does not work. The more you try to manage their behavior, the more they resist. The more they resist, the more you try. It is a cycle that exhausts both of you and helps neither of you.

Signs that you may be falling into codependency include: your emotional state is dictated by their screen use; you spend more time thinking about their problem than about your own life; you have given up hobbies, friendships, or self-care to focus on them; you feel responsible for fixing them; you feel guilty when you do something for yourself.

Recognizing this pattern is not a failure. It is an act of courage. And the way out starts with a simple, difficult truth: you are not responsible for their choices. You are responsible for yours.

**Reflection**: Read the signs of codependency listed above. Do any of them resonate? Be gentle with yourself. This is not about blame. It is about awareness.

**Key takeaway**: Trying to control someone else's screen use can become its own compulsive pattern. Recognizing codependency is the first step toward breaking the cycle.

---

### Lesson 4: Putting Yourself Back on the List

**Learning goal**: Identify and commit to specific actions that restore your own wellbeing, independent of the other person's behavior.

You have spent a lot of energy on them. That is understandable. But right now, we are going to talk about you. Not as a supporter. Not as a partner, parent, or friend. Just as a person who deserves to be well.

Self-care is not selfish. It is structural. You cannot sustain the kind of patience, compassion, and clarity that this situation requires if you are running on empty. This is not a luxury. It is a necessity.

Start small. Not with a complete life overhaul, but with one or two things that are just for you. Things that remind you that you are a whole person with your own interests, needs, and pleasures. Exercise. Time with a friend. A book that has nothing to do with screen addiction. A walk without your phone. A therapist or counselor — not because something is wrong with you, but because you are dealing with something hard and you deserve support too.

Pay attention to your sleep. Research shows that supporter stress disrupts sleep, and poor sleep makes everything harder — your patience, your judgment, your mood, your health. Protect your sleep the way you would protect anything precious.

Consider connecting with others who understand. Support groups for families of people with compulsive behaviors exist for a reason. Hearing someone else say, "I know exactly what that feels like" can be one of the most healing experiences available. You are not alone in this, even if it feels that way.

And give yourself permission to feel joy. You are allowed to laugh. You are allowed to have a good day even if they are still struggling. Your happiness does not betray them. It sustains you.

**Exercise**: Write down three things you used to do for yourself that you have stopped doing. Circle one. Commit to doing it this week. Put it in your calendar. Treat it as non-negotiable.

**Key takeaway**: Taking care of yourself is not selfish. It is the foundation that makes everything else possible.

---

### Module 3 Challenge: One Thing for You

This week, do one thing that is purely for your own wellbeing. Not to help them. Not to model good behavior. Not to prove a point. Something that fills your cup. It could be small — a bath, a walk, a phone call with a friend, an hour with a book. It could be bigger — starting therapy, joining a support group, signing up for a class. Whatever it is, do it. And then write down what you did and how it felt. You matter in this story too.

---

# Module 4: First Steps

## What you can actually do right now

---

### Lesson 1: What You Can Control (And What You Cannot)

**Learning goal**: Distinguish clearly between what is within your power to change and what is not, and find peace in that distinction.

This is the lesson that changes everything. And it is also the hardest to accept.

You cannot make another person change. You cannot control how much they use their screen. You cannot force them to see the problem. You cannot want recovery for them hard enough to make it happen. This is true whether the person is your partner, your child, your friend, or your sibling.

What you can control is yourself. Your responses. Your boundaries. Your own behavior. The environment you create. The way you communicate. The support you offer. The life you live. These are not small things. They are the only things that matter.

This distinction — between control and influence — is at the heart of everything that works in this space. Motivational Interviewing, the most evidence-based approach to helping someone change a compulsive behavior, is built entirely on the premise that you cannot force change. You can only create conditions where change becomes more possible.

Ross Greene, a clinical psychologist who developed the Collaborative and Proactive Solutions model, says it simply: control invites resistance. Collaboration invites change. When you try to control someone's screen use — through rules, monitoring, ultimatums, or punishment — you almost always get pushback, deception, or resentment. When you approach with genuine curiosity and a willingness to solve the problem together, something different becomes possible.

This does not mean you are powerless. It means your power lies in a different place than you thought.

**Reflection**: What have you been trying to control? What has the result been? Be honest. This is not about fault. It is about finding what actually works.

**Key takeaway**: You cannot control another person's screen use. But you have more influence than you think — and it starts with what you can control.

---

### Lesson 2: Small Moves, Not Grand Interventions

**Learning goal**: Understand why gradual, gentle approaches are more effective than dramatic ultimatums, and identify small moves you can make.

It is tempting to want a big moment. A confrontation. An intervention. A line in the sand. And sometimes, in certain circumstances, something like that is necessary. But research and clinical experience consistently show that small, steady changes are more effective than dramatic ones.

Why? Because big moves trigger big defenses. If someone feels attacked, threatened, or cornered, they shut down. They defend. They dig in. The very behavior you want to change becomes something they cling to more tightly because now it is also about their autonomy, their dignity, their sense of self.

Small moves work differently. They are gentle enough to slip past defenses. They are consistent enough to shift patterns over time. They are sustainable in a way that grand gestures are not.

A small move might be: eating one meal a day together, screens off, with no commentary about it. A small move might be: asking a genuine, curious question about what they are doing on their screen, without judgment. A small move might be: inviting them to do something specific with you — not "let's spend less time on screens" but "want to walk to the park with me on Saturday?"

Small moves also protect you. They do not require you to spend all your emotional energy on a single confrontation. They allow you to maintain your equilibrium while still moving in a direction of change.

**Exercise**: Think of three small moves you could make this week. They should be things you can do regardless of how the other person responds. Write them down. Keep them specific and realistic.

**Key takeaway**: Small, consistent moves are more powerful than grand interventions. They slip past defenses and create lasting change.

---

### Lesson 3: Creating Invitations, Not Demands

**Learning goal**: Learn to offer alternatives and opportunities that the other person can freely choose, rather than issuing demands that trigger resistance.

There is a fundamental difference between an invitation and a demand. A demand says: "You need to get off that screen." An invitation says: "I am going to make dinner. Want to help me chop vegetables?"

A demand backs someone into a corner. An invitation opens a door. They can walk through it or not. But the door is there. And over time, if you keep opening doors without punishing them for not walking through, something remarkable often happens. They start to walk through.

This is not passive. It is strategic. And it is deeply rooted in evidence. Motivational Interviewing teaches that people are more likely to change when they feel they have chosen the change, not when they feel it has been forced upon them. Every time you create an invitation instead of a demand, you honor their autonomy — and paradoxically, that makes change more likely.

Invitations also protect the relationship. Demands create conflict. Conflict creates distance. Distance makes the screen more appealing because the screen never criticizes, never demands, never makes someone feel inadequate. When you keep the relationship warm despite the problem, you become a viable alternative to the screen rather than another thing to escape from.

This does not mean you never express your needs. It does not mean you become a doormat. Boundaries are different from demands, and we will explore that distinction in the next course. But for now, practice the art of the invitation. It costs less energy than a fight. And it works better.

**Reflection**: Think about the last time you made a demand about their screen use. What happened? Now imagine if you had offered an invitation instead. What might have been different?

**Key takeaway**: Invitations honor autonomy and keep the relationship warm. They are more effective than demands — and they cost you less.

---

### Lesson 4: Your First-Steps Plan

**Learning goal**: Create a concrete, realistic, short-term plan of actions you will take this week, based on everything you have learned.

You have come a long way in this course. You have validated your own feelings. You have understood the science behind compulsive screen use. You have tended to your own pain. And now, it is time to put it together into something you can actually do.

Your plan does not need to be ambitious. In fact, it should not be. The most effective plans are small enough to actually follow through on. They are specific enough to know when you have done them. And they are focused on what you can control, not on what the other person does.

Here is a framework for your plan. First, one thing for your own wellbeing. This is non-negotiable. You cannot support anyone effectively if you are depleted. Pick something specific and schedule it. Second, one small invitation. Not a demand. Not a conversation about screen use. Just an invitation to connect. Something you can offer without attachment to the outcome. Third, one observation practice. Continue being a curious, compassionate observer of what is happening — both in them and in you.

That is it. Three things. One for you. One for connection. One for understanding. You can build from here. The next course in this series will give you specific communication tools and help you navigate harder conversations. But this week, keep it simple.

You are not behind. You are not failing. You are learning a new way of approaching something painful, and that takes time. Be as patient with yourself as you are learning to be with them.

**Exercise**: Write your First-Steps Plan. Be specific. "I will go to yoga on Wednesday at 6 p.m." is better than "I will take care of myself." "I will invite them to walk the dog with me on Sunday morning" is better than "I will create connection." "I will notice what happens right before they pick up their phone" is better than "I will pay attention."

**Key takeaway**: A good plan is small, specific, and focused on what you can control. Three things this week. That is enough.

---

### Module 4 Challenge: Three Things I Will Try

Write down three small, specific, non-controlling actions you will take this week. One for your own wellbeing. One as an invitation to connect. One as an observation practice. They should be things you can do regardless of how the other person responds. Share them with a trusted friend, or write them somewhere you will see them every day. At the end of the week, write down what happened. Not whether it "worked" — but what you noticed, what you learned, and how you felt.

gamma_prompt: |
  Create a deeply empathetic, visually warm slide deck titled "Someone I Love Is Lost in Screens." The tone must be gentle and validating — like sitting with a trusted counselor, not attending a lecture. Use calming, grounding colors (warm earth tones, soft blues, muted greens). Include visuals that show connection and disconnection — two people in the same room but worlds apart, a hand reaching out. Show the compensatory internet use model as a simple diagram. Include the supporter stress cycle. Represent diverse relationships — partners, parents, friends, siblings. Each module gets its own section. End with the "Three Things I Will Try" planning activity. Never show shame-based imagery. Show hope.

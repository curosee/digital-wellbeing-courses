# Module 1: The System Behind the Screen

## How tech companies design for addiction

---

### Lesson 1: Beyond Design Tricks: The Business Model

**Learning Goal:** Understand the fundamental business model that drives tech addiction and why individual design features are symptoms of a deeper systemic issue.

In the foundations course, you learned about pull-to-refresh, infinite scroll, and autoplay. Those are real and they matter. But they are symptoms, not the disease. The disease is the business model itself.

Most of the apps you use every day are built on a single economic model: advertising. The company creates a product that is free to use. It attracts millions or billions of users. Then it sells access to those users' attention to advertisers. The more time users spend in the app, the more ads they see, the more money the company makes.

This is not a neutral business model. It creates a very specific incentive. The company is not incentivized to make you happy. It is not incentivized to make you informed or connected or fulfilled. It is incentivized to keep you looking at the screen. Happiness, connection, and fulfillment might sometimes align with that goal. But when they do not, the company still optimizes for screen time.

This is why features that are bad for users persist. The company knows that infinite scroll makes people feel empty. Internal research at Meta, leaked in 2021, showed they knew Instagram was harmful to teen mental health. But the feature stayed because it drove engagement. The business model made the harmful feature profitable.

This is also why the problem is systemic, not individual. It is not one bad company or one bad feature. It is an entire industry built on the same fundamental incentive. Until the business model changes, every company will be pushed toward the same attention-maximizing design choices.

Understanding this matters because it changes how you respond. You stop thinking "I just need more willpower" and start thinking "the system is designed against me, so I need to be strategic." That shift in perspective is the difference between self-blame and empowerment.

Some alternatives are emerging. Subscription models where you pay for the product instead of being the product. Platforms that optimize for time well spent rather than time spent. Cooperative models where users own the platform. These are still small, but they show that a different approach is possible.

**Exercise:** Think about the three apps you use most. For each one, answer these questions. How does it make money? What behaviors does that business model incentivize? Can you identify a specific feature that is good for the company's revenue but bad for your wellbeing? Write your analysis for each app. This exercise trains you to see the system, not just the surface.

**Key Takeaway:** Addictive design features are symptoms of a business model that profits from your attention. Understanding the systemic incentive helps you move from self-blame to strategic response.

### Lesson 2: Persuasive Design at Scale

**Learning Goal:** Understand the academic field of persuasive technology and how its principles are applied to billions of users simultaneously.

There is an entire academic field dedicated to making technology persuasive. It was largely pioneered at Stanford's Persuasive Technology Lab by B.J. Fogg. His behavior model states that behavior happens when three things converge: motivation, ability, and a trigger. Apps are designed to maximize all three.

Motivation. The app provides something you want: social connection, entertainment, information, validation. Ability. The app makes the behavior as easy as possible: one tap to open, one swipe to scroll, zero friction. Trigger. The app provides a prompt at the right moment: a notification, a red badge, a vibration.

When all three align, behavior happens automatically. You do not decide to check your phone. The trigger arrives, the motivation is there, the action is effortless, and you are scrolling before your conscious mind catches up.

This framework is not inherently evil. It can be used to help people exercise more, take their medication, or learn a language. The problem is scale and intent. When the framework is used to maximize engagement for advertising revenue across billions of people, it becomes something else entirely. It becomes a machine for exploiting human psychology at an unprecedented scale.

Dark patterns take this further. Dark patterns are design choices that deliberately trick users into doing things they do not want to do. Making the "delete account" option hard to find. Pre-selecting opt-ins for data sharing. Using confusing language so you accidentally agree to something. These patterns are not accidental. They are tested and refined.

The people designing these systems are not villains. Most went into tech wanting to build good things. But the incentive structures push them toward engagement maximization whether they like it or not. Several former employees of major tech companies have spoken publicly about this tension. They built the features and then watched them cause harm they did not intend.

Knowing this framework helps you recognize persuasion when it is happening. When you feel a compulsion to check your phone, you can ask: what is the trigger? What is the motivation? How has this been made easy? That awareness creates a gap between the trigger and your response. In that gap, you have a choice.

**Exercise:** Over the next 24 hours, catch yourself being persuaded by technology at least 5 times. For each instance, identify the trigger, the motivation, and the ease factor. Write them down. At the end, look at the pattern. Which element is most powerful for you: the triggers, the motivation, or the ease? That tells you where to focus your defense.

**Key Takeaway:** Persuasive design uses the convergence of motivation, ability, and triggers to create automatic behavior. Recognizing these elements in real time gives you the power to pause and choose.

### Lesson 3: The Algorithm Knows You

**Learning Goal:** Understand how recommendation algorithms work, how they learn your vulnerabilities, and how they shape your worldview without your awareness.

The algorithm is not a mysterious force. It is a prediction machine. Its job is to predict what content will keep you engaged. And it gets better at that job every day because you teach it.

Every action you take on a platform feeds the algorithm data. What you click. How long you watch. What you skip. What you like. What you share. What you watch twice. What time of day you are most active. What emotional state you seem to be in based on your behavior. All of this creates a model of you, a digital profile that the algorithm uses to serve you content optimized for engagement.

Here is the problem. Engagement is not the same as enjoyment or benefit. Content that makes you angry is engaging. Content that makes you anxious is engaging. Content that triggers insecurity is engaging. The algorithm does not distinguish between "this person is watching because they love it" and "this person is watching because they cannot look away from a car crash." Both register as engagement.

This means the algorithm can learn your vulnerabilities and exploit them without anyone programming it to do so. If you tend to engage more when you see content about body image, you will see more body image content. If you engage with political outrage, you will see more outrage. The algorithm is not malicious. It is amoral. It does not care about your wellbeing. It cares about prediction accuracy.

This creates what researchers call "filter bubbles" and "rabbit holes." The algorithm serves you more of what it predicts you will engage with, which is often more extreme or more emotionally triggering versions of what you have already engaged with. You start by watching one video about a topic and end up, 30 minutes later, in a corner of the internet you never intended to visit.

The algorithm also shapes your worldview without you noticing. What you see determines what you think about. What you think about shapes what you believe. What you believe shapes who you become. When an algorithm controls what you see, it has an outsized influence on who you become. That is a lot of power for a prediction machine optimized for ad revenue.

**Exercise:** Open TikTok or YouTube (or your most algorithm-driven platform) and look at your "For You" page or recommended feed. What does the algorithm think you want to see? What does that say about what you have been engaging with? Are you comfortable with the version of you that the algorithm has built? Write an honest reflection on what you see.

**Key Takeaway:** Recommendation algorithms learn your behaviors and vulnerabilities to maximize engagement. They are amoral prediction machines that can exploit insecurities and shape your worldview. Awareness of how they work is your first defense.

### Lesson 4: Who Is Pushing Back

**Learning Goal:** Learn about the growing movement of individuals and organizations working to reform technology and promote digital wellness.

You are not alone in thinking this system needs to change. A growing movement of technologists, researchers, advocates, and young people is pushing back against designed addiction.

The Center for Humane Technology, co-founded by former Google design ethicist Tristan Harris, has been one of the most visible organizations in this space. Their argument is straightforward: technology should serve humanity, not exploit it. They work with tech companies, policymakers, and the public to promote a technology industry that is aligned with human wellbeing rather than attention extraction.

Emma Lembke founded LOG OFF when she was a teenager in Alabama. She noticed the impact social media was having on her own mental health and the mental health of her peers, and she decided to do something about it. LOG OFF is a youth-led movement that advocates for a healthier relationship between young people and technology. Emma did not wait for adults to solve the problem. She started the conversation herself.

The dumb phone movement is another form of pushback. Sales of basic phones, the kind with no apps and no internet, have spiked 148% among 18-to-24-year-olds. Young people are voluntarily choosing less technology, not because they are anti-tech, but because they want more control. Companies like Light Phone have built entire brands around the idea of a phone that does less.

Legislative efforts are happening too. The EU's Digital Services Act, various US state laws around children's online safety, and global conversations about age-appropriate design all represent attempts to change the systemic incentives we discussed in Lesson 1. These are imperfect and slow-moving, but they matter.

Researchers are producing evidence that matters. The studies we have cited throughout this course, about dopamine, about the 30-minute rule, about FOMO prevalence, about structured strategies reducing addiction symptoms by 47%, all come from researchers committed to understanding this problem and finding solutions.

And then there is you. If you have made it to this course, you are already part of the solution. You understand the system. You have changed your own habits. You have the knowledge to help others. The movement needs people who get it and who can talk about it in a way that resonates with their peers.

**Exercise:** Research one of the organizations or individuals mentioned in this lesson. LOG OFF, Center for Humane Technology, Light Phone, or someone else working in this space. Spend 15 minutes learning about their work. Write a short summary of what they do and what impressed you most. Share it with someone.

**Key Takeaway:** A growing movement of technologists, researchers, youth advocates, and everyday people is pushing back against designed addiction. You are part of this movement. The more you know, the more you can contribute.

# Module 2: Know Yourself

## Advanced self-awareness and emotional triggers

---

### Lesson 1: Emotional Triggers: The Deep Dive

**Learning Goal:** Move beyond surface-level trigger identification to understand the specific emotional patterns that drive your screen habits.

In the foundations course, you mapped your triggers. You probably identified things like boredom, stress, FOMO, and habit. That was a great start. Now we go deeper.

Most screen habits are driven not by simple emotions but by specific emotional combinations. It is not just "boredom." It is "boredom plus loneliness on a Sunday afternoon." It is not just "stress." It is "stress about something I cannot control combined with a need to feel like I am doing something."

Getting specific matters because the more precisely you understand your triggers, the more effectively you can respond to them. A generic response to "stress" is much less useful than a specific response to "the anxiety I feel after a difficult conversation with a friend."

Here are some emotional triggers that often fly under the radar.

Transition moments. The moment between activities, when you finish one thing and have not started the next, is peak phone-pickup time. Your brain is in limbo. The phone fills the gap.

Social discomfort. When you are in a social situation that feels awkward, the phone becomes a shield. Waiting alone in a public place. Standing at the edge of a party where you do not know anyone. The phone says "I am busy" so you do not have to say "I am uncomfortable."

Performance anxiety. Before something stressful, like a test, a presentation, or a difficult conversation, scrolling offers a temporary escape from the anticipatory anxiety. It does not help with the thing you are anxious about. But it delays having to think about it.

Comparison and inadequacy. This one is sneaky. Sometimes you open social media specifically because you are feeling good, but then 10 minutes of comparing yourself to others brings you down. The trigger was not negative emotion. The negative emotion was the result.

Emotional numbness. Sometimes the trigger is not feeling too much. It is not feeling enough. A kind of flatness or emptiness that screens fill with noise and stimulation. This is one of the hardest triggers to identify because it does not feel like anything. It feels like nothing. And that is the point.

**Exercise:** For the next 48 hours, every time you pick up your phone, pause and go deeper than the obvious trigger. Ask yourself: what am I feeling right now, specifically? Write it down in as much detail as you can. After 48 hours, look at your entries. You will likely see patterns that are more specific and more interesting than "bored" or "stressed."

**Key Takeaway:** Surface-level trigger identification is a start, but real change comes from understanding the specific emotional combinations that drive your screen habits. The deeper your awareness, the more precise your response can be.

### Lesson 2: The Needs Beneath the Screen

**Learning Goal:** Understand that every screen habit meets a legitimate human need, and learn to identify and meet those needs in healthier ways.

Here is something that might change how you think about your screen habits. Every time you reach for your phone, you are trying to meet a real need. The need is legitimate. The method is just not always the best one.

Psychologists have identified several core human needs. Connection. Competence. Autonomy. Stimulation. Escape. Identity. Belonging. Recognition. Every one of these needs is valid. And screens offer to meet every one of them.

Connection. Social media promises human connection. Competence. Games let you level up, achieve, and master challenges. Autonomy. Your phone gives you control over your experience: what you watch, what you read, who you talk to. Stimulation. Short-form video provides endless novelty. Escape. Scrolling takes you out of whatever you do not want to deal with. Identity. Your online presence lets you craft who you are. Belonging. Online communities let you find your people. Recognition. Likes and followers give you a sense of being seen.

The problem is not the needs. The problem is that screens meet these needs just enough to keep you coming back, but not enough to actually satisfy you. It is the difference between fast food and a real meal. Fast food fills you up temporarily, but you are hungry again an hour later. Screens give you a quick hit of connection, competence, or belonging, but the deep need remains unmet.

The advanced move is to identify which need each screen habit is meeting and then find a way to meet that need more fully. If you scroll when you are lonely, the need is connection. A phone call meets that need better than scrolling. If you game when you feel incompetent at life, the need is competence. Working on a real-world skill meets that need better than gaming.

This is not about judging your screen use. It is about understanding it deeply enough to make better choices. When you know what you actually need, you can get it in a way that truly satisfies.

**Exercise:** Look at your top 3 most-used apps. For each one, identify the primary need it meets. Then write down one non-screen way you could meet that same need more fully. Be specific. Not "hang out with friends" but "call Marcus on Wednesday evening and ask him how his week was."

**Key Takeaway:** Every screen habit meets a legitimate human need. Screens meet those needs partially, which keeps you coming back without ever feeling satisfied. Identifying the real need and meeting it more fully is the key to sustainable change.

### Lesson 3: Mindfulness Without the Woo

**Learning Goal:** Develop practical mindfulness skills for catching autopilot behavior and making conscious choices about attention.

Mindfulness has a branding problem. When most people hear the word, they picture someone sitting cross-legged on a mountain, chanting. That is one form of mindfulness. It is not the only one, and it is not what we are talking about here.

Mindfulness, in practical terms, is just noticing what is happening right now. That is it. Noticing your thoughts, your feelings, your body, and your surroundings. Not judging them. Not changing them. Just noticing.

Why does this matter for screen habits? Because most of your phone use happens on autopilot. You pick up the phone without deciding to. You open Instagram without thinking about it. You scroll for 20 minutes without awareness. The phone pickup is a reflex, not a choice.

Mindfulness interrupts the autopilot. It creates a tiny gap between the urge and the action. In that gap, you can choose. Do I actually want to check my phone right now? Or is this just a reflex? That moment of awareness changes everything.

Here are three practical mindfulness techniques that work in real life, not on a mountaintop.

**The STOP technique.** When you notice yourself reaching for your phone, Stop. Take a breath. Observe what you are feeling. Proceed with intention. This takes about 10 seconds. It does not require a meditation cushion. It just requires the habit of pausing.

**The body scan.** When you feel the urge to check your phone, scan your body. Where do you feel the urge? Is there tension in your chest? Restlessness in your hands? Tightness in your stomach? Noticing the physical sensation of the urge helps you recognize it as just a sensation, not a command.

**Noting.** When thoughts pull you toward your phone, silently label them. "That is FOMO." "That is boredom." "That is habit." Labeling the thought creates distance between you and the thought. You are not the urge. You are the person noticing the urge.

These techniques get easier with practice. Like any skill, they feel awkward at first and become more natural over time. You do not need to be perfect at them. You just need to use them often enough that they start showing up when you need them.

**Exercise:** Practice the STOP technique 5 times today. Every time you reach for your phone, Stop, Take a breath, Observe what you feel, and then Proceed with intention. You might still pick up the phone. That is fine. The goal is the pause, not the outcome. At the end of the day, write down what you noticed about your urges when you actually paid attention to them.

**Key Takeaway:** Mindfulness is the practice of noticing what is happening right now. It interrupts autopilot phone use by creating a gap between the urge and the action. Three practical techniques, STOP, body scan, and noting, can be used anywhere.

### Lesson 4: Your Relationship Timeline with Tech

**Learning Goal:** Reflect on how your relationship with technology has evolved over your life and use that understanding to shape your future intentionally.

Your relationship with technology has a history. It has changed over time. Understanding that history helps you see where you are now more clearly, and it helps you decide where you want to go.

Think back to your first experiences with screens. Maybe it was a family computer. A tablet. A game console. What was it like? For most people, early screen experiences were magical. Everything was new. Everything was exciting. There were no complicated feelings about it.

Then think about when you got your first phone. For many people, this was a turning point. Suddenly, a screen was always available. Always in your pocket. The relationship shifted from "I use a screen sometimes" to "a screen is part of me."

Think about when social media entered the picture. The first time you posted something and waited for likes. The first time you compared yourself to someone online. The first time you felt left out because of something you saw on a screen. The emotional landscape changed.

Think about now. Where are you in your relationship with technology? Is it where you want to be? Are you in control, or does it feel like the relationship has gotten away from you?

This timeline exercise is not about nostalgia or regret. It is about awareness. When you see the arc of your relationship with technology, you can identify the moments where things shifted. Those moments usually correspond to specific changes: a new device, a new app, a new social dynamic, a period of stress where screens became a coping mechanism.

Understanding your story gives you authorship over the next chapter. You are not a passive recipient of whatever technology throws at you. You are a person with a history, a present, and a future you get to shape.

**Exercise:** Draw a timeline of your relationship with technology from your earliest memory to now. Mark the key moments: first screen, first phone, first social media account, the moment you first felt it was becoming too much, any periods where you tried to change, and where you are now. For each key moment, write one sentence about how your relationship with screens changed. Use this timeline to identify patterns and turning points.

**Key Takeaway:** Your relationship with technology has evolved over time, with specific turning points that shifted the dynamic. Understanding your personal history gives you the awareness to intentionally shape what comes next.

# Module 3: Help a Friend Without Being Annoying

## Peer support that works

---

### Lesson 1: Why Lecturing Never Works

**Learning Goal:** Understand the psychology of reactance and why telling someone they should change their screen habits usually pushes them further away.

You have done the work. You understand the system. You have changed your own habits. And now you watch a friend doom-scrolling for three hours and you want to say something. So you tell them they should use their phone less.

And it backfires.

This is one of the most frustrating experiences in life: knowing something that could help someone and watching them reject it. But understanding why it backfires is the first step to actually helping.

The reason is a psychological phenomenon called reactance. When people feel their freedom is being threatened, they push back. Hard. Even if the thing you are suggesting is obviously good for them. If someone tells you "you should eat healthier," your instinct is not gratitude. Your instinct is to order a pizza. Reactance is automatic and powerful.

When you lecture a friend about their screen habits, you are implicitly saying "I know better than you how you should live." Even if that is true, it triggers reactance. They feel judged. They feel controlled. They push back to protect their sense of autonomy. And now they are more committed to their screen habits than they were before you said anything.

This is why traditional drug education fails. This is why nagging does not work. This is why "just say no" was never effective. Telling people what to do activates the exact opposite response.

The bias blind spot makes this even harder. Remember, 48% of teens think social media has a mostly negative effect on their age group, but only 14% think it affects them personally. So when you point out the problem, your friend agrees. In general. But they do not think it applies to them.

So what does work? That is what the rest of this module is about. Spoiler: it involves a lot more listening and a lot less talking.

**Exercise:** Think about a time someone gave you unsolicited advice about something you were not ready to change. How did it feel? What did you do? Write down your reaction. Now think about a time someone helped you change without lecturing. What did they do differently? Understanding both sides of this experience will make you a better supporter.

**Key Takeaway:** Lecturing triggers psychological reactance, which pushes people further into the behavior you are trying to change. Understanding this is essential before trying to help a friend with their screen habits.

---

### Lesson 2: The Art of the Right Question

**Learning Goal:** Learn motivational interviewing techniques adapted for peer conversations about screen habits.

Motivational interviewing is a counseling approach developed by psychologists William Miller and Stephen Rollnick. It is used by therapists, doctors, and counselors worldwide. The core idea is that people are more likely to change when they talk themselves into it than when someone else tries to convince them.

You are not a therapist. But you can use the basic principles of motivational interviewing in your everyday conversations. And they work remarkably well for peer support around screen habits.

The first principle is asking open-ended questions instead of making statements. Instead of "you are on your phone too much" (statement, triggers reactance), try "how do you feel about how much time you spend on your phone?" (question, invites reflection). The question opens a door. The statement closes one.

The second principle is reflective listening. When your friend answers, reflect back what you heard. "So it sounds like you enjoy the social part but the endless scrolling after midnight is bothering you." This shows you are listening, not waiting for your turn to lecture. And it helps your friend hear their own thoughts from the outside.

The third principle is asking about the gap. Most people who struggle with screen habits already know there is a gap between how they want to use technology and how they actually use it. Help them articulate that gap. "What would your ideal relationship with your phone look like?" or "If you could change one thing about your screen habits, what would it be?"

The fourth principle is supporting autonomy. Always. Whatever your friend decides, it is their decision. You are not there to fix them. You are there to help them think. "Whatever you decide to do, I support you" is one of the most powerful things you can say.

The beauty of this approach is that it often leads people to say the things you wanted to say. But because they said it themselves, they own it. It becomes their insight, not your lecture.

**Exercise:** Practice asking open-ended questions about screen habits in a low-stakes conversation. With a friend, sibling, or classmate, try asking: "How do you feel about your screen time lately?" and then just listen. Use reflective listening. Do not give advice unless they ask for it. Afterward, write about how the conversation went and what you learned.

**Key Takeaway:** People change when they talk themselves into it, not when someone else talks them into it. Open-ended questions, reflective listening, and supporting autonomy are more powerful than any lecture.

---

### Lesson 3: Sharing Your Story

**Learning Goal:** Learn how to talk about your own screen habit journey in a way that inspires others without sounding preachy.

Your personal experience is your most powerful tool. Not statistics. Not studies. Your story. Because stories bypass the defenses that lectures trigger.

When you share your own experience, you are not telling someone what to do. You are sharing what happened to you. That is a fundamentally different dynamic. There is no reactance because there is no threat to their autonomy. You are just telling your story. They can take from it whatever resonates.

But how you share your story matters a lot. There are ways to do it that open doors and ways that close them.

Do share your vulnerability. "I realized I was spending four hours a day scrolling and it was making me feel awful" is powerful because it is honest and human. It normalizes the struggle. It says "I went through this too."

Do share what surprised you. "I turned my phone to grayscale and I was shocked at how much less I wanted to use it." Surprising details are interesting. They make people curious. Curiosity is the opposite of defensiveness.

Do share what it cost you. "I was staying up until 2 AM and my grades were slipping" connects your story to real consequences without lecturing about consequences.

Do share what changed and how. "I tried a 7-day experiment and the phone-free mornings were life-changing for me" gives people a concrete example they might want to try.

Do not make it about them. The moment you pivot from "here is what happened to me" to "and you should do the same," you have lost them. Share your story and let them draw their own conclusions.

Do not present yourself as having it all figured out. If you come across as someone who has conquered all screen problems and now lives in perfect digital harmony, you are not relatable. You are intimidating. Be real. Share what is still hard. Share where you still struggle. Imperfection is more inspiring than perfection.

**Exercise:** Write a 2-minute version of your screen habit story. Include when you first realized there was a problem, what you tried, what worked, what did not, and where you are now. Practice telling it out loud. Then share it with one person this week. Not as advice. Just as a story. Notice their reaction.

**Key Takeaway:** Your personal story is your most powerful peer support tool. Share it with vulnerability, honesty, and without making it about the other person. Stories bypass defenses in ways that advice never can.

### Lesson 4: When to Step Back and When to Step Up

**Learning Goal:** Recognize the difference between someone who needs gentle peer support and someone who needs professional help, and know how to respond appropriately in both cases.

There is a line between "my friend uses their phone a lot" and "my friend is in real trouble." Knowing where that line is, and what to do on each side of it, is one of the most important things you can learn.

On one side of the line, your friend is like most people. They use their phone more than they would like to. They scroll when they are bored. They stay up too late. They know it is not great but it is not ruining their life. For this person, the peer support tools from this module work well. Questions. Listening. Sharing your story. Being a good example. That is enough.

On the other side of the line, something more serious is happening. Your friend cannot stop even when they want to. Their grades are falling apart. They are isolating from friends and family. They are showing signs of depression, anxiety, or self-harm. They are using screens to escape problems that are getting worse, not better. Gaming disorder affects 4.6% of adolescents. Serious social media-related mental health issues affect many more.

For this person, peer support is not enough. They need professional help. A school counselor, a therapist, a doctor, a crisis line. And your role shifts from "supportive friend" to "concerned friend who helps them access support."

This is a hard shift. You might worry about overreacting. You might worry about betraying their trust. You might worry about being wrong. Here is a useful guideline: if you are genuinely worried about someone's wellbeing, you are not overreacting. Trust your instincts.

How to step up: express concern without judgment. "I have noticed you seem really stressed lately and I am worried about you." Offer specific help. "Would you want me to come with you to talk to the school counselor?" Know the resources. Have the Crisis Text Line number (text HOME to 741741), know where your school counselor's office is, know what mental health resources are available in your community.

And take care of yourself too. Supporting a friend through a mental health crisis is emotionally heavy. You are not a therapist. You do not need to carry their weight alone. Make sure you have your own support system in place.

**Exercise:** Make a mental health resource card. Write down the Crisis Text Line number, your school counselor's name and office location, one local mental health resource, and one trusted adult you could talk to if you were worried about a friend. Keep this card somewhere accessible. You may never need it. But if you do, you will be glad you have it.

**Key Takeaway:** Peer support works for everyday screen struggles, but some situations require professional help. If a friend is showing signs of serious mental health issues, your role is to help them access support, not to be their therapist. Know the resources before you need them.

# Module 4: Your Digital Boundaries

## Creating a personal digital philosophy

---

### Lesson 1: What Do You Actually Value

**Learning Goal:** Identify your core personal values and evaluate how your technology use aligns or conflicts with them.

Before you can build a digital philosophy, you need to know what matters to you. Not what your parents think should matter. Not what social media says matters. What actually matters to you.

Values are not goals. Goals are things you want to achieve. Values are how you want to live. A goal might be "get good grades." The value underneath might be "learning" or "mastery" or "making my family proud." Values are deeper and more stable than goals.

Here are some values people commonly hold. Connection. Creativity. Freedom. Health. Honesty. Adventure. Growth. Kindness. Independence. Justice. Fun. Family. Loyalty. Courage. Peace. There are many more. And everyone has a different combination.

The point of identifying your values is that they become your compass for technology use. When you know what you value, you can ask: is my screen time aligned with my values or at odds with them?

If you value connection and you are using your phone to maintain real relationships, that is alignment. If you value connection but your phone time is mostly passive scrolling that leaves you feeling disconnected, that is conflict.

If you value creativity and your screen time involves making things, learning, and creating content, that is alignment. If you value creativity but you are spending three hours a day consuming other people's content without creating anything yourself, that is conflict.

If you value health and your phone is helping you track fitness, find healthy recipes, and connect with active people, that is alignment. If you value health but your phone is keeping you up until 2 AM and replacing movement with sitting, that is conflict.

This is not about perfection. Nobody has perfect alignment between their values and their behavior. But the bigger the gap, the worse you feel. And most people, when they really look at their screen habits through the lens of their values, notice a significant gap.

**Exercise:** Write down your top 5 personal values. Take your time. These should be things that genuinely matter to you, not things you think should matter. For each value, rate on a scale of 1 to 10 how well your current screen habits support that value. Where you see low numbers, that is where the misalignment lives. That is where change will make the biggest difference.

**Key Takeaway:** Your values are your compass for technology use. When you know what matters to you, you can evaluate your screen habits through that lens and close the gaps between how you want to live and how you are actually living.

### Lesson 2: Writing Your Digital Philosophy

**Learning Goal:** Create a personal digital philosophy that articulates your relationship with technology based on your values and intentions.

A digital philosophy is not a set of rules someone else wrote. It is a statement of who you want to be with technology. It is written by you, for you, based on your values and your experience. Nobody else needs to approve it. Nobody else needs to follow it. It is yours.

Why write it down? Because a philosophy that lives only in your head changes shape whenever it is convenient. When you are tired at midnight and want to scroll, your mental philosophy conveniently adjusts to allow "just a few more minutes." A written philosophy holds steady. It reminds you of what you decided when you were thinking clearly.

Here is a framework for writing your digital philosophy.

Start with your why. Why does your relationship with technology matter to you? What have you experienced that makes this important? This is the foundation. When you are tempted to abandon your philosophy, your why brings you back.

State your values. What do you care about, and how do you want technology to serve those values?

Define your principles. These are the guidelines you choose to live by. Not rigid rules. Principles. Principles have flexibility built in. "I value sleep, so I keep screens out of my bedroom" is a principle. It does not say "I will never check my phone at 11 PM." It says this is what I value and this is how I honor it.

Name your boundaries. What specific practices support your principles? Phone-free mornings. Social media time limits. No phones at meals. A weekly digital sabbath. Whatever fits your life and your values.

Acknowledge your imperfection. A good digital philosophy includes grace. "When I fall short, I will not shame myself. I will reflect, adjust, and keep going." This is essential. Without it, the first slip becomes a reason to abandon the whole thing.

Your digital philosophy does not have to be long. It can be a single page. What matters is that it is honest, specific, and written in your own voice.

**Exercise:** Write the first draft of your digital philosophy. Use the framework above. Spend at least 20 minutes on it. Do not worry about making it perfect. A rough first draft that you can refine is better than a perfect document that you never write. When you are done, read it out loud. Does it sound like you? Does it reflect what you actually believe?

**Key Takeaway:** A written digital philosophy turns vague intentions into concrete commitments. It is your personal document, based on your values, your principles, and your boundaries. Writing it down makes it real.

### Lesson 3: Advanced Boundary Strategies

**Learning Goal:** Explore advanced strategies for digital wellness including digital sabbaths, phone-free zones, and seasonal social media use.

You have the basics: app timers, notification detox, grayscale mode. Those are powerful. But if you are ready for more, here are some advanced strategies that people serious about digital wellness use.

**The digital sabbath.** One day per week, you significantly reduce or eliminate screen use. Some people go completely screen-free. Others limit to essential communication only. The idea comes from religious sabbath traditions but works regardless of your beliefs. A full day without screens once a week resets your baseline. Things that seemed boring before your phone feel interesting again. Conversations go deeper. Boredom leads to creativity. It is one of the most powerful practices in digital wellness.

**Phone-free zones.** Designate specific spaces in your life as phone-free. The bedroom. The dinner table. The classroom. The bathroom (yes, really). When you create physical spaces where screens do not exist, you create pockets of your life that are untouched by digital distraction.

**Social media seasons.** Instead of using social media every day forever, use it in seasons. Maybe you take January off every year. Maybe you take a week off every month. Maybe you use social media during the school year but not during summer. Seasons give you regular resets and prevent the slow accumulation of habitual overuse.

**The attention audit.** Once a month, review your screen time data. Look at the trends. Are you spending more time or less? On which apps? Is the trend going in the direction you want? Monthly check-ins prevent gradual drift back toward old patterns.

**The accountability partnership.** Find someone who shares your goals. Check in weekly. Share your wins and your struggles. Hold each other accountable with compassion, not judgment. Research consistently shows that accountability improves outcomes for behavior change.

**The intention setting.** Before you pick up your phone, state your intention out loud or in your head. "I am picking up my phone to text Sarah." When you are done texting Sarah, put the phone down. The stated intention prevents the drift from "text Sarah" to "text Sarah, check Instagram, watch three TikToks, read the news, and look at that weird article about aliens" that happens when you pick up without intention.

**Exercise:** Choose one advanced strategy from this lesson that you have not tried before. Commit to trying it for two weeks. Write down specifically what you will do and when. At the end of two weeks, evaluate. Did it work? Did it fit your life? Will you continue it?

**Key Takeaway:** Advanced strategies like digital sabbaths, phone-free zones, social media seasons, and monthly attention audits are powerful tools for people who are ready to go deeper with their digital wellness practice.

### Lesson 4: Holding Your Boundaries When No One Else Does

**Learning Goal:** Develop resilience and strategies for maintaining your digital philosophy when your social environment does not support it.

This is the hardest part. You have done the work. You have your philosophy. You have your boundaries. And then you sit down with your friends and they are all on their phones. Or someone texts you at midnight and expects an immediate response. Or everyone at the party is posting stories and you are the only one not documenting the moment.

Maintaining digital boundaries in a culture that does not share them is an act of quiet courage. It is not dramatic. Nobody will make a movie about you putting your phone away at dinner. But it takes real strength to be different when everyone around you is doing the same thing.

Here are strategies for holding your boundaries.

Lead by example, not by announcement. You do not need to make a big declaration about your digital philosophy. Just live it. Put your phone away when you are with people. Be fully present. Over time, people notice. And some of them will follow your lead because it looks appealing, not because you told them to.

Have a simple explanation ready. If someone asks why you are not on your phone, keep it light. "I am trying to be more present." "I am doing an experiment." "I just feel better when I am not on it all the time." You do not need to justify yourself. A simple, confident explanation is enough.

Find your people. You do not need everyone in your life to share your digital philosophy. But having even one or two people who get it makes a massive difference. Find them. They are out there. The fact that sales of basic phones have spiked 148% among young adults means this is not a fringe movement. It is growing.

Expect pushback. Some people will not understand. Some might tease you. Some might feel judged by your choices even though you are not judging them. That is their discomfort, not your problem. You do not need everyone's approval to live according to your values.

Remember your why. When maintaining your boundaries feels hard, go back to your digital philosophy. Read your why. Remember what you have gained. Remember how it feels to be in control of your attention instead of at the mercy of an algorithm. That feeling is worth the occasional social friction.

**Exercise:** Think about the three situations where maintaining your digital boundaries will be hardest. For each one, write down a specific strategy for handling it. What will you do? What will you say if someone questions you? How will you stay grounded in your values? Having a plan for the hard moments makes them much easier to navigate.

**Key Takeaway:** Maintaining digital boundaries in a screen-saturated culture requires quiet courage. Lead by example, have a simple explanation ready, find your people, and remember your why. You do not need everyone to agree with your choices.

# Module 5: Lead the Movement

## Becoming a digital wellness advocate

---

### Lesson 1: From Personal to Public

**Learning Goal:** Understand how your personal journey with digital wellness gives you credibility and power to help others.

Everything you have learned in this course pathway, from understanding the system to changing your own habits to developing a personal philosophy, has given you something valuable. It has given you a story, knowledge, and credibility that most people your age do not have.

You know what 46% of your peers are experiencing. You know why 50% feel addicted. You know about dopamine, the attention economy, and persuasive design. You have done the experiments, faced the discomfort, and come out the other side with more control over your life. That is not nothing. That is a lot.

The question now is: what do you do with it?

You do not have to do anything. Seriously. If your digital wellness journey is personal and you want to keep it that way, that is completely valid. Not everyone needs to be an activist or a leader. Taking care of yourself is more than enough.

But if you feel a pull to do more, if you see your friends struggling and wish someone would talk about this stuff in a way that actually makes sense, if you think your school or community could benefit from this conversation, then this module is for you.

Going from personal practice to public advocacy is a natural extension of the work you have done. You are not a random person telling others what to do. You are someone who has lived this, struggled with it, and found something that works. That lived experience is more powerful than any credential.

Emma Lembke was 15 when she started LOG OFF. She did not have a degree in psychology or a position at a tech company. She had her own experience, a clear analysis of the problem, and the willingness to speak up. That was enough to start a movement that resonated with millions of young people.

Your sphere might be smaller. A friend group. A class. A school. A community. But the impact of one person who speaks honestly and acts consistently should not be underestimated.

**Exercise:** Write down three specific things you have learned on your digital wellness journey that you wish someone had told you sooner. These are the seeds of your advocacy message. For each one, think about who in your life would benefit from hearing it. Not everyone. Specific people or groups.

**Key Takeaway:** Your personal journey with digital wellness gives you lived experience and credibility that is more powerful than any textbook. Going from personal to public is a natural step for those who feel called to help others.

### Lesson 2: Starting Small and Real

**Learning Goal:** Identify practical, low-barrier ways to promote digital wellness in your immediate community.

The best advocacy starts small. Not with a TED talk or a viral social media campaign. With a conversation. A lunch table. A club. Something real and manageable that you can actually do this week.

Here are ideas that work, ordered from smallest to largest.

**Phone-free hangouts.** The next time you are with friends, suggest a phone stack. Everyone puts their phones in a pile. You hang out without them. That is it. You have just created a mini digital wellness experience.

**Conversation starters.** Share one thing you learned from this course in a natural conversation. Not a lecture. Just something interesting. "Did you know 46% of teens are online almost constantly?" or "I tried this thing called grayscale mode and it is wild how much less I use my phone." You are planting seeds.

**A weekly phone-free lunch.** Talk to a few friends about doing one lunch per week where nobody checks their phones. Make it a regular thing. It becomes a small tradition that normalizes device-free socializing.

**A digital wellness club.** If your school allows clubs, start one. It does not need to be big. Even 5 people meeting weekly to talk about their screen habits and support each other is meaningful. Use peer support models. Share strategies. Hold each other accountable.

**A conversation with a teacher or counselor.** If your school does not have any digital wellness programming, suggest it. Talk to a teacher you trust or a school counselor. Share what you have learned. Offer to help. Adults are often looking for ways to address this issue but do not know where to start.

**A presentation or workshop.** If you are comfortable speaking, offer to do a short presentation for a class, a youth group, or a community event. Ten minutes of real talk from someone their own age will have more impact on teens than an hour-long lecture from an expert.

Start with one of these. The smallest one that feels doable. Do it this week. Then see what happens.

**Exercise:** From the list above, choose one action you could realistically take in the next 7 days. Write down exactly what you will do, when you will do it, and who will be involved. Then do it. After, write about what happened and how it felt.

**Key Takeaway:** Effective advocacy starts small and real. A phone-free lunch, a conversation with a friend, or a chat with a school counselor are all legitimate starting points. Pick one thing and do it this week.

### Lesson 3: Using Your Voice

**Learning Goal:** Learn how to use social media as a tool for digital wellness advocacy without hypocrisy, and explore other channels for your message.

Here is the irony. One of the most effective ways to advocate for digital wellness is through social media. The very platforms you are encouraging people to use more intentionally are also the best way to reach them.

This is not hypocrisy. Using social media intentionally and purposefully, to share a message you believe in, is fundamentally different from mindless scrolling. A carpenter uses a hammer deliberately. A person being hit by a hammer is not. The tool is the same. The relationship to it is different.

If you want to use social media for advocacy, here are some principles.

Be authentic, not performative. Share your real experience. The messy parts. The struggles. The victories. People connect with authenticity, not perfection. Do not present yourself as someone who has it all figured out.

Be conversational, not preachy. Nobody wants to be lectured on social media. Start conversations. Ask questions. Share interesting findings. Invite discussion. "Has anyone else tried a phone-free morning? Here is what happened when I did" is far more engaging than "everyone should stop using their phones in the morning."

Share data that surprises people. The bias blind spot (48% think social media negatively affects their age group, but only 14% think it affects them) is a great example. Surprising data cuts through the noise and makes people think.

Respect your audience. Your followers are dealing with the same systems you are. They are not stupid for being on their phones too much. They are human. Speak to them with the respect you would want.

Practice what you preach. If you are posting about digital wellness, your own habits should reflect that. Not perfectly. But consistently. Walking the walk gives your words weight.

Beyond social media, consider other channels. School newspapers. Blog posts. Podcast conversations. Art. Music. Film. Whatever medium speaks to you and reaches the people you want to reach. Your message does not have to live on the platforms you are critiquing.

**Exercise:** Create one piece of digital wellness content. It could be a social media post, a short video, a blog entry, or anything else. Share one thing you have learned or experienced. Use the principles from this lesson. Post it or share it. See what response you get.

**Key Takeaway:** Using social media to advocate for digital wellness is not hypocritical when it is intentional and purposeful. Be authentic, conversational, and respectful. And explore channels beyond social media for your message.

### Lesson 4: The Long Game

**Learning Goal:** Develop a sustainable approach to digital wellness advocacy that avoids burnout and maintains your own wellbeing.

Advocacy is a marathon, not a sprint. And the biggest risk for anyone who cares deeply about a cause is burnout. You start passionate. You do a lot. You pour energy into the cause. And then you are exhausted, cynical, and burned out. That helps nobody.

Sustainable advocacy requires taking care of yourself first. You cannot pour from an empty cup. If your own digital wellness habits are falling apart because you are spending all your time advocating for digital wellness, something has gone wrong.

Here are principles for the long game.

Your own practice comes first. Always. Your digital philosophy, your boundaries, your habits. These are the foundation. If they start slipping, pull back from advocacy and tend to your own garden. You are not useful to the movement if you are burned out.

Set boundaries around your advocacy. Just like you set boundaries around screen time, set boundaries around the time and energy you spend on advocacy work. Decide how much you are willing to give and stick to it.

Celebrate small wins. You started a phone-free lunch and three people came. That is a win. You had a conversation with a friend and they tried grayscale mode. That is a win. You are not going to dismantle the attention economy single-handedly. But every small change matters.

Find community. Connect with others who care about this issue. Locally, nationally, or online. LOG OFF has a community. The Center for Humane Technology has resources. There are digital wellness groups on campuses and in communities. You do not have to do this alone.

Remember that structural change matters. Individual behavior change is important, but systemic change, in business models, in policy, in platform design, is what will ultimately solve this problem at scale. Support organizations pushing for structural change. Vote for leaders who take tech regulation seriously. The personal and the political are connected.

And finally, be patient with the world. Change is slow. Not everyone will be ready when you are. That is okay. Your job is to keep showing up, keep living your values, and keep the conversation going. The movement is growing. The numbers are moving in the right direction. And you are part of that.

**Exercise:** Write a one-year vision for your digital wellness advocacy. Where do you want to be a year from now? What do you want to have accomplished? What impact do you want to have had? Then break it into quarterly goals and monthly actions. Start with the first month. What is one thing you will do?

**Key Takeaway:** Sustainable advocacy requires taking care of yourself first, celebrating small wins, finding community, and being patient with the pace of change. This is a long game, and the movement needs you for years, not just weeks.

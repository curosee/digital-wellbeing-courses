  Create a visually striking presentation for teens and young adults (ages 13-25) about becoming digital wellness leaders and advocates. Bold, modern, activist-inspired design. Cover the systemic design behind tech addiction, advanced self-awareness techniques, peer support strategies, personal digital philosophy creation, and community advocacy. Feature real changemakers like Emma Lembke and organizations like the Center for Humane Technology. Tone should be empowering and action-oriented — this is about leading a movement, not just managing a personal habit. Include practical frameworks for advocacy and peer support. No preaching. Just tools, truth, and the power to make a difference.

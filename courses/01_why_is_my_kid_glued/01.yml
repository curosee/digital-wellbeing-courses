gamma_prompt: |
  Create a warm, visually engaging slide deck for parents titled "Why Is My Kid Glued to That Screen?" The tone should be supportive and non-judgmental — like a wise friend, not a lecturer. Use clean, modern design with calming colors (soft blues, greens, warm neutrals). Include simple brain science visuals (dopamine pathways, pleasure-pain balance), the AAP 5 C's framework as a memorable graphic, and reflective prompts for parents. Avoid fear-based imagery. Show diverse families. Each module gets its own section with clear transitions. End with the Family Screen Map activity as a practical takeaway.

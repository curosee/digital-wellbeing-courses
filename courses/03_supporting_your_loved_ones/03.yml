    Audience:
    - Partners, parents, and friends of someone who spends a lot of time on screens.
    - They feel worried, tired, or hurt, and want to help without constant conflict.
    - They are not clinicians and are not trying to diagnose.

    - Show communication and boundary tools that protect both sides.
    - Provide a calm overview of the four modules.
    - Encourage self-care and realistic expectations.

    Tone:
    - Empathetic to both supporter and loved one.
    - Clear, simple, and respectful.
    - Avoid blame, pathologizing, or dramatic language.

       - Needs screens may be meeting: escape, success, belonging, comfort.

       - Validating the supporter’s own pain.

    7–9. Module 2 overview: Conversations That Open Doors
       - When not to talk.

       - Mention printable reflection sheets and pocket aids for supporters.
       - Emphasize that the supporter cannot fully control outcomes but can care wisely.

    Design guidelines:

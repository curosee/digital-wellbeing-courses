gamma_prompt: |
  Create a deep, thoughtful slide deck for parents titled "Raising Humans in a Digital World — From Screen Police to Digital Mentor." The tone is wise, empathetic, and empowering. Use sophisticated, clean design with deeper, richer colors (navy, forest green, warm amber). Include visuals of the Hook Model, OARS conversation technique, a graduated freedom framework, and the mentor vs. monitor spectrum. Show diverse families navigating real situations. Include infographics for gaming disorder criteria, cyberbullying statistics, and the self-regulation development timeline. End with the mentor mindset and long-game vision. This is a mastery-level course — the design should feel elevated and confident.

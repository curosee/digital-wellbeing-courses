## Content Guidelines

### Tone
- **Warm and personal** — write like you're talking to a friend over coffee
- **Non-judgmental** — never shame screen use; acknowledge it meets real needs
- **Evidence-informed** — cite research but keep it accessible
- **Empowering** — the reader already has strengths; help them see that
- **Short sentences** — translatable across cultures and languages
- **Inclusive** — respect diverse family structures, economic situations, and cultural contexts

### What We Avoid
- Fear-based messaging ("screens are destroying your brain")
- Absolutist language ("you must never," "always do this")
- Clinical jargon without explanation
- Blaming parents, youth, or anyone for their habits
- Culture-specific idioms that don't translate
- Emojis in course content

### Structure
Each course follows this structure:
- **YML file**: metadata, modules, lessons, gamification, slide prompts
- **MD file**: full lesson content, exercises, challenges

Each module contains:
- 4–5 lessons with clear learning goals
- Practical exercises (printable where possible)
- A hands-on challenge
- A badge and XP rewards

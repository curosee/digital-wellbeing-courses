## Who Is This For?

We all struggle with screens — whether it's our own doomscrolling at 2 AM, our kid who won't put the tablet down, or a friend who seems to have disappeared into their phone. These courses meet you where you are.

### Four Pathways

| Pathway | Who It's For | Courses |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Parent** | Parents helping children build healthy screen habits | 3 levels |
| **Self** | Adults working on their own digital habits | 3 levels |
| **Youth** | Young people (13–25) taking charge of their screen life | 3 levels |
| **Supporter** | Anyone worried about someone else's screen use | 3 levels |

Each pathway has three levels: **Foundations → Skills → Mastery**.

## How Courses Are Built

Each course folder contains:

- **`*.yml`** — Course metadata: title, goals, modules, lessons, gamification, and slide prompts.
- **`*.md`** — Full course content in Markdown: lesson text, exercises, challenges, and resources.

### Evidence-Based Approach

Every course is informed by peer-reviewed research, clinical guidelines, and expert frameworks:

- **AAP / WHO / AACAP** screen time guidelines and the 5 C's framework
- **Neuroscience** of dopamine, attention, and habit formation (Lembke, Alter)
- **Behavioral science** of habit change (Eyal, Fogg, Clear)
- **Digital parenting** research (Uhls, Heitner, Weinstein)
- **Center for Humane Technology** insights on persuasive design
- **Motivational Interviewing** and **Collaborative Problem-Solving** (Greene)

We never shame. We never fearmonger. We always offer the nuanced view.

### Gamification

- **Badges** for each module completed
- **XP** for reading, exercises, and challenges
- **Practical challenges** that bridge learning and real life

### Tone & Writing Style

- Warm, direct, and personal — like a wise friend who's been there
- Short sentences, translatable across languages
- Non-judgmental — screens aren't the enemy; imbalance is
- Empowering — you already have what it takes
- Evidence-informed, never preachy
